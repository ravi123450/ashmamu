2
00:01:36,067 --> 00:01:40,067
My name is Karan... Karan Choudhry.

3
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:45,067
Samir... Samir Sharma.

4
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:34,025
Hey guys ! Gurukul ?

5
00:02:40,025 --> 00:02:44,108
This was their first meeting. Even they
did not know then that this...

6
00:02:44,108 --> 00:02:49,108
little acquaintance at the station,
would lead to a lifetime of friendship.

7
00:03:47,067 --> 00:03:52,025
Quite a big room.

8
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,817
First come first served, guys!
This bed is mine.

9
00:03:57,817 --> 00:04:02,650
Oh God! Is this a bed or a rock...?
Can't do anything about it, can we ?

10
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,442
Now that we are in Gurukul,
We have to study.

11
00:04:06,442 --> 00:04:09,442
Even if the bed feels like a rock,
We have to sleep.

12
00:04:09,442 --> 00:04:12,942
Hey guys! That was a cool poem,
wasn't it?

13
00:04:12,942 --> 00:04:16,525
No one is listening. No reaction.

14
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:20,900
lf you guys snore at night,
just let me know...

15
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,692
so I can hustle up
some cotton for my ears.

16
00:04:23,692 --> 00:04:26,192
That's because I really cherish my
eight hours of sleep,...

17
00:04:26,192 --> 00:04:29,983
dreaming of pretty girls!
So let me know, thanks ....

18
00:04:32,817 --> 00:04:38,192
What's that ? Who's voice is that ?

19
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:48,192
Who is that ?

20
00:04:49,192 --> 00:04:53,567
That is the principal of Gurukul.
The one and only, Mr. Narayan Shankar.

21
00:06:15,817 --> 00:06:22,400
Tradition, Honor and Discipline.

22
00:06:25,192 --> 00:06:29,900
These are the three pillars
of Gurukul,...

23
00:06:31,192 --> 00:06:35,983
the values with which
we shape your future.

24
00:06:36,858 --> 00:06:38,858
Those who have been here...

25
00:06:38,858 --> 00:06:42,983
have set very high standards for you.

26
00:06:42,983 --> 00:06:46,775
Today, all of them are successful men
in their own respective fields

27
00:06:46,775 --> 00:06:51,275
some are great writers, great
businessmen and some great politicians.

28
00:06:51,775 --> 00:06:58,150
But all of them have one thing
in common. All their lives...

29
00:06:58,775 --> 00:07:03,067
they have followed the principles
taught to them, by this Gurukul.

30
00:07:03,067 --> 00:07:07,567
Today you have the opportunity
to be a part of this great lineage.

31
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:15,358
You have been selected from all over
the country, and brought here...

32
00:07:15,358 --> 00:07:20,025
because we believe that you have
what it takes to be great men.

33
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:25,317
But success does not come so easily.

34
00:07:25,317 --> 00:07:29,817
Behind every great success
lies a great sacrifice.

35
00:07:32,817 --> 00:07:35,400
By entering this institution today,...

36
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:40,733
you have shut yourself
from the outside world.

37
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,692
We expect that you will work
with full concentration,...

38
00:07:46,692 --> 00:07:51,900
and follow the rules and regulations of
this institution with strict discipline.

39
00:07:52,817 --> 00:07:56,692
lf any one is found
guilty of misconduct,...

40
00:07:56,692 --> 00:08:00,775
he will be expelled immediately.
And remember one thing.

41
00:08:01,275 --> 00:08:06,483
Once you are expelled from here the
doors of all other...

42
00:08:07,192 --> 00:08:11,983
educational institutions would also
be shut for you, forever.

43
00:08:14,275 --> 00:08:18,358
So if there is anyone here who is
not willing to make this sacrifice,...

44
00:08:20,275 --> 00:08:23,858
then he is free to walk out
of that gate right now.

45
00:08:24,858 --> 00:08:27,567
But if you have decided
to stay here,...

46
00:08:27,567 --> 00:08:33,150
then that gate and the world outside
does not exist for you anymore.

47
00:08:40,358 --> 00:08:45,442
Now I want all of you to close
your eyes, bow your heads...

48
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:51,858
and think of every word
I have said to you,...

49
00:08:51,858 --> 00:08:56,525
and make your own decision.

50
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,400
Vicky! That's my photograph!
-I can see that, my friend,...

51
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,317
but who is this lady in red with you?
-Nobody, give it back to me.

52
00:12:41,317 --> 00:12:46,525
Stop it, Vicky...
what are you doing?

53
00:12:49,692 --> 00:12:52,192
Oh God! it’s you.
You scared us.

54
00:12:52,192 --> 00:12:55,692
Come here quickly.
I've got something to show you.

55
00:12:57,192 --> 00:12:58,400
Who is this?

56
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,192
This? Romeo and Juliet,
Heer Ranjha,...

57
00:13:02,192 --> 00:13:04,400
Samir and ...Samir and ...?

58
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,900
Sanjana! And it's nothing
like what you think.

59
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:13,067
She's just a good friend of mine...
actually, she was a friend.

60
00:13:13,275 --> 00:13:14,983
She was a friend?

61
00:13:14,983 --> 00:13:18,692
Sanju was my childhood friend.
We were best friends.

62
00:13:18,692 --> 00:13:22,983
We were neighbors and
literally grew up together.

63
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:28,483
We had this photograph taken at
a funfair. It was her birthday,...

64
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:32,775
and the next day, she was
supposed to leave. Forever.

65
00:13:32,775 --> 00:13:37,358
Her father had been transferred and
that was the last time that I saw her.

66
00:13:40,358 --> 00:13:44,858
That was six years ago.
I was just fourteen years old

67
00:13:45,567 --> 00:13:47,525
But do you know where she is now?

68
00:13:47,525 --> 00:13:50,858
I heard a few months ago that she
could be in this very town.

69
00:13:50,942 --> 00:13:53,858
That's great! Which means that
you know where she lives?

70
00:13:53,858 --> 00:13:56,817
No, I don't.
And I don't want to find out.

71
00:13:56,817 --> 00:13:57,442
Why not?

72
00:13:57,817 --> 00:14:02,317
Because it's been a long time and I do
not know if she will recognize me...

73
00:14:02,317 --> 00:14:04,733
or whether she would
like to meet me or not.

74
00:14:04,733 --> 00:14:09,108
So, we'll meet if we are destined to.
Otherwise we won't.

75
00:14:12,108 --> 00:14:15,400
Hey Samir! You really love this girl.

76
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,025
Oh no, nothing of the sort.
she's just an old friend.

77
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,525
Shut up! Just an old friend!

78
00:14:21,525 --> 00:14:23,108
Tell me something. How many other
old friends' photographs...

79
00:14:23,108 --> 00:14:26,817
have you been carrying with you
for the last six years?

80
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,608
That's the bell for your love!

81
00:14:28,608 --> 00:14:30,317
Come on, it's time to sleep.

82
00:14:30,317 --> 00:14:32,108
Old friend, my foot!

83
00:14:32,108 --> 00:14:34,192
I wish I had that photograph
in my pocket. By now,...

84
00:14:34,192 --> 00:14:37,775
I'd have been in her house, relishing
the savories she'd make for me.

85
00:14:37,775 --> 00:14:42,608
And look at you! ''We'll meet if we're
destined to; otherwise, we won't''

86
00:14:46,567 --> 00:14:50,400
Know what, Karan! There's a girls'
hostel behind our college?

87
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,400
So what do I do?
-Oh no. You don't do anything.

88
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,692
You just think.
And I'll do it.

89
00:14:57,275 --> 00:15:00,858
Oh shit! I'm late.
Why do we have to begin so early?

90
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:05,067
Where is my sleeve...?

91
00:15:13,067 --> 00:15:15,942
Who's that...?
Stop there!

92
00:15:15,942 --> 00:15:19,942
Stop it! You thief.

93
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:48,942
Ishika! Miss Monica is coming!
Hurry up!

94
00:16:01,317 --> 00:16:06,025
Ishika! . Ishk....

95
00:16:19,192 --> 00:16:22,900
We're through at last! Let's return...
I’m terribly hungry.

96
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,400
We've still got to buy mineral water.
-It was there in the shop back there

97
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,067
You guys take the stuff to the jeep.
I'll go and get it.

98
00:16:30,067 --> 00:16:33,692
You're always thinking about food.
You know nothing else, do you.

99
00:16:36,483 --> 00:16:38,275
How much is this for?
-''dedh'' rupees

100
00:16:38,275 --> 00:16:39,483
How can it be ''Dedh''?

101
00:16:39,483 --> 00:16:40,858
The real price is
''dhai'' rupees.

102
00:16:40,858 --> 00:16:42,358
No madam, it's for ''dedh'' rupees.

103
00:16:42,358 --> 00:16:44,858
I know everything. The price is
''dhai'' rupees ...

104
00:16:44,858 --> 00:16:48,150
and I will pay you accordingly . not
a penny more, not a penny less.

105
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:51,275
Please try to understand what I say...
-I will listen to nothing!

106
00:16:51,275 --> 00:16:53,358
Do you want to give it or don't you?
Tell me clearly.

107
00:16:53,358 --> 00:16:56,358
But ma'am... it costs ''dedh'' rupees,
Not ''dhai'' rupees!

108
00:16:56,358 --> 00:17:00,150
Only last week my friend bought
the same thing from your shop...

109
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,150
at ''dhai'' rupees.
-Maybe,...

110
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:05,567
but the price now is ''dedh'' rupees.
-But I’ll pay ''dhai'' Rupees.

111
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:10,358
Quickly pack it for me.
-Somebody, please make her see reason

112
00:17:10,442 --> 00:17:13,442
''We'll meet, if we are destined to.''

113
00:17:13,525 --> 00:17:16,942
Are you giving it or not?
-How can I charge...

114
00:17:16,942 --> 00:17:18,942
''dhai'' rupees when it costs
''dedh'' rupees?

115
00:17:18,942 --> 00:17:22,442
I don't know! I’ll pay ''dhai''...
here's the money, if you want it.

116
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:26,525
By the way, ''dedh'' is lesser than
''dhai'' Rupees.

117
00:17:27,942 --> 00:17:30,108
Is it really...?
-That's just what I was...

118
00:17:30,108 --> 00:17:33,817
trying to explain.
-How much is ''Dedh'' rupees?

119
00:17:33,817 --> 00:17:37,025
Well... one and a half rupees.

120
00:17:37,025 --> 00:17:39,817
Ok, so give it to me for
one and a half rupees.

121
00:17:39,817 --> 00:17:44,108
As you wish.
Your bangles and change.

122
00:17:52,608 --> 00:17:53,900
Show me these bangles, please.

123
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,983
For you?
-Yes

124
00:17:54,983 --> 00:17:57,192
What?
- No, for a friend of mine...

125
00:17:57,192 --> 00:18:01,400
that red one,...
yes, the green one...

126
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:07,692
Samir.....Samir Sharma !
-Sanju....

127
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:16,192
What are you doing here?
-Me ... I am a student at Gurukul.

128
00:18:16,192 --> 00:18:18,775
Not bad, Mr. Sharma.
-Cool huh !

129
00:18:18,775 --> 00:18:21,192
Which means you've been here
for so long,...

130
00:18:21,192 --> 00:18:25,483
and did not even bother to call me!
-I didn't have your telephone number.

131
00:18:25,983 --> 00:18:27,983
Stop making excuses!

132
00:18:27,983 --> 00:18:30,650
The truth is that you
didn't even think of me,...

133
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:34,275
so it did not bother you whether
I was in this town or not.

134
00:18:34,275 --> 00:18:37,067
What is my phone number !

135
00:18:37,067 --> 00:18:39,358
Excuse me ma'am.
-This is mine. Thank you.

136
00:18:39,358 --> 00:18:40,150
What is it?

137
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,358
Nothing... just the list
of things I had to buy.

138
00:18:42,358 --> 00:18:47,525
Have you found everything?
-Yes... I’ve found everything.

139
00:18:48,858 --> 00:18:51,150
So come with me!
I’m going to set you straight!

140
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:54,025
Who do you think you are...? Just
because you're a student at Gurukul...

141
00:18:54,025 --> 00:18:57,233
you think you can act tough!
We're going home straight away.

142
00:18:57,233 --> 00:19:00,442
Papa will be so happy to see you.
-Sanju, I cannot come now,...

143
00:19:00,442 --> 00:19:03,233
I’ve got to return to Gurukul.
-Then promise you'll come on Sunday.

144
00:19:03,233 --> 00:19:08,108
A true promise?
-True promise.

145
00:19:17,108 --> 00:19:21,692
Khan Baba, when is the train from
Aligarh scheduled to arrive?

146
00:19:22,817 --> 00:19:27,525
The train should be here any moment.
Whom have you come to receive?

147
00:19:28,025 --> 00:19:30,608
The professor of my college.
-I see...

148
00:19:30,608 --> 00:19:35,317
the train should be here any moment.

149
00:19:46,983 --> 00:19:51,067
Khan Baba, who's that girl?

150
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:57,067
That's Kiran.
She comes here quite often.

151
00:19:59,275 --> 00:19:59,775
Kiran!

152
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:37,650
Hey! Gurukul. Are you from Gurukul?
...No, No, it’s OK.

153
00:20:49,525 --> 00:20:54,233
Shall we leave?
-Yes sir...

154
00:21:07,608 --> 00:21:12,317
Ok guys, this is it! I have decided!
The first thing tomorrow morning...

155
00:21:12,317 --> 00:21:14,983
I’m going to cross that gate,
enter that girls' hostel,...

156
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:18,275
and wherever that girl is,
I am going to find her,...

157
00:21:18,275 --> 00:21:23,692
and look deep into her eyes
and tell her . You're beautiful.

158
00:21:24,108 --> 00:21:26,483
I am going to do it!

159
00:21:26,483 --> 00:21:28,400
Now you guys tell me
what you'll have decided.

160
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,692
What say, Samir? Is she going to be
just a friend all your life.

161
00:21:35,358 --> 00:21:41,692
For years, I have been
just a friend of hers.

162
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:45,150
But now it's time to move ahead.

163
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:47,775
Hey Karan! What have you thought ?

164
00:21:47,775 --> 00:21:50,275
I am going to think of her as the most
beautiful dream I’ve ever had,...

165
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:54,358
and forget about her.
-What? Don't be such a sissy!

166
00:21:54,942 --> 00:21:58,067
You guys must've have forgotten,
but I still remember every word ...

167
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:02,233
Narayan Shankar uttered: ''if you
break the rules of Gurukul...''

168
00:22:02,233 --> 00:22:04,067
''you will be expelled immediately.''

169
00:22:04,067 --> 00:22:06,858
Oh c'mon, Karan!
Don't be so scared!

170
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:09,025
People usually go overboard
during a speech...

171
00:22:09,025 --> 00:22:11,358
that doesn't mean that one has to
take it so seriously.

172
00:22:11,358 --> 00:22:14,358
Narayan Shankar means
every word he says.

173
00:22:14,358 --> 00:22:18,150
He has done it earlier,
and he can do it again.

174
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:21,025
What has he done earlier?

175
00:22:21,025 --> 00:22:23,525
it’s a famous story.

176
00:22:23,525 --> 00:22:26,233
There used to be this student here
a few years ago,

177
00:22:26,233 --> 00:22:30,525
He was brilliant. Everyone thought
he would do something in life.

178
00:22:32,025 --> 00:22:38,025
But he made the mistake of breaking
a rule of Gurukul . he fell in love.

179
00:22:41,108 --> 00:22:44,900
Narayan Shankar expelled him without
even seeing him or meeting him.

180
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,900
And, as everyone knows,...

181
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:51,108
once you're expelled from here,
you cannot get admission elsewhere.

182
00:22:51,108 --> 00:22:57,692
Today, no one knows where he is
or what has happened to him.

183
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:05,983
As for the girl he loved,
she committed suicide.

184
00:23:08,275 --> 00:23:12,275
She was Narayan Shankar's
one and only child!

185
00:23:15,983 --> 00:23:20,567
Everyone thought that this incident
would soften Narayan Shankar.

186
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:25,567
Instead, it only made him harder.

187
00:23:27,567 --> 00:23:32,067
So I’m neither a sissy nor a coward...

188
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:37,275
but I am not strong enough to
fight Mr. Narayan Shankar.

189
00:23:37,275 --> 00:23:42,150
I am not that strong.

190
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:52,650
I guess she is destined to be
just a friend of mine.

191
00:23:55,525 --> 00:23:59,150
You will have to wait
a little, Ishk...

192
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:04,317
till someone comes and
saves us from Narayan Shankar.

193
00:24:07,108 --> 00:24:09,525
What do you want?
You can't get inside.

194
00:24:09,525 --> 00:24:14,233
Go away... Go!

195
00:24:36,817 --> 00:24:39,900
I can't do this on my own.
Where have you been?

196
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,900
I was at the market to
get all the stuff,...

197
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:47,692
and you are having
problems with the bulb.

198
00:24:48,067 --> 00:24:52,483
Mr. Seera, I had asked you for
some paperwork. Is it ready?

199
00:24:52,483 --> 00:24:56,192
Yes, sir, it's ready.
-Please leave it on my table.,

200
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:33,025
What's happening here?

201
00:25:38,733 --> 00:25:42,025
Good morning sir!
My name is Raj Aryan.

202
00:25:42,025 --> 00:25:44,817
I have an appointment with you, sir.
-Don't you know...

203
00:25:44,817 --> 00:25:48,525
that there are students here who are
trying to concentrate on their work?

204
00:25:48,525 --> 00:25:51,733
Don't you understand that you mustn't
make noise in a place like this?

205
00:25:51,733 --> 00:25:55,025
I’m sorry sir. it’s just that the
little girl saw the violin in my hand..

206
00:25:55,025 --> 00:25:58,900
and insisted on hearing it.
I just couldn't break her heart.

207
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:02,108
It is more important
not to break rules here.

208
00:26:02,108 --> 00:26:02,692
Follow me.

209
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:36,775
So you teach music.
-Yes sir.

210
00:26:36,775 --> 00:26:40,567
And you want to be given the opportunity
to teach music in this university.

211
00:26:40,567 --> 00:26:41,567
Yes sir.

212
00:26:43,858 --> 00:26:46,358
Being fully aware of the
traditions of the Gurukul?

213
00:26:46,358 --> 00:26:47,150
Yes.

214
00:26:47,983 --> 00:26:51,567
Knowing for a fact that no form of
music has ever been taught here,...

215
00:26:51,567 --> 00:26:56,650
nor probably will it ever be?
-Yes sir

216
00:27:01,567 --> 00:27:05,650
I read here that you have already been
offered jobs in 3 other universities..

217
00:27:06,442 --> 00:27:11,442
and yet you have come here all
the way to seek a job . Why?

218
00:27:16,233 --> 00:27:20,525
I was told that you would not
allow me to teach music here.

219
00:27:21,025 --> 00:27:25,817
They said that it was impossible.

220
00:27:25,817 --> 00:27:31,025
It seemed like a challenge to me
and I like challenges.

221
00:27:35,025 --> 00:27:39,733
And what makes you think that you
can make me change my mind.

222
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,900
From what I have
heard about you, sir...

223
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:48,608
I think even you
like challenges. Right sir?

224
00:27:58,608 --> 00:28:01,900
How can your music help my students?

225
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:05,483
Students remain buried in their
books the whole day, sir.

226
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:09,983
Music will rejuvenate them and make
their learning process less stressful.

227
00:28:09,983 --> 00:28:12,692
Besides, they will end up learning
music, which is a joy in itself.

228
00:28:12,692 --> 00:28:14,483
Music is a wonderful thing sir!
it’s...

229
00:28:14,483 --> 00:28:20,483
What happens if you do not find enough
students, who want to learn music?

230
00:28:21,275 --> 00:28:25,358
That's no problem, sir.
I’ll pack this small bag, and leave.

231
00:28:25,358 --> 00:28:30,150
I’ll be gone.

232
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:38,150
I like your self-confidence Mr. Aryan.
-Thank you sir.

233
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:40,733
I will give you one opportunity.

234
00:28:40,733 --> 00:28:46,067
If you do find enough students wishing
to learn music in their spare time,...

235
00:28:46,567 --> 00:28:51,150
you've got yourself a job.
Otherwise, you will leave.

236
00:29:14,108 --> 00:29:19,108
Yes, set it here....
thank you.

237
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:19,900
That's quite a classroom you've
made for yourself, Mr. Aryan.

238
00:31:20,483 --> 00:31:23,400
I’m sorry sir! I just thought,
that at the end of the day...

239
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:27,567
the students would feel much
better being outside. That's all.

240
00:31:28,567 --> 00:31:34,067
You already have ten more students
registered since yesterday.

241
00:31:34,483 --> 00:31:38,775
That's quite an achievement in one day.
-Thank you sir! As I said...

242
00:31:38,775 --> 00:31:39,775
music is such a wonderful thing....sir

243
00:31:39,775 --> 00:31:43,275
You have the job, Mr. Aryan.

244
00:31:43,275 --> 00:31:48,150
This is the contract.
Please read it carefully and sign it.

245
00:31:53,942 --> 00:31:57,358
Mr. Aryan, you're about to
become a part of Gurukul.

246
00:31:57,358 --> 00:32:01,858
I would like to explain something.
-Please do.

247
00:32:04,233 --> 00:32:06,525
For the last 25 years,...

248
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:10,650
I have run this place with tradition,
honor, and discipline.

249
00:32:11,525 --> 00:32:15,233
Nothing has changed since then.

250
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:21,025
Which is why Gurkul has retained
its pristine glory.

251
00:32:22,025 --> 00:32:25,525
Yesterday, you changed
the order of a few chairs.

252
00:32:25,525 --> 00:32:29,525
Tomorrow, you might want
to change something else.

253
00:32:30,608 --> 00:32:35,233
I do not like change of
any kind, Mr. Aryan.

254
00:32:35,233 --> 00:32:40,108
I just don't like changes.

255
00:32:45,317 --> 00:32:49,317
I understand sir.

256
00:32:49,317 --> 00:32:53,817
Good. Welcome to Gurukul Mr. Aryan .

257
00:33:38,442 --> 00:33:42,733
Love... the greatest inspiration
for music.

258
00:33:44,358 --> 00:33:46,525
Love and music are very
closely connected to each other.

259
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:48,650
Both originate from the heart...

260
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:52,858
and the destinies of both depend on
whether the heart expresses it or not.

261
00:33:53,525 --> 00:33:59,233
lf you love somebody...
just go and tell her.

262
00:33:59,817 --> 00:34:03,233
Don't worry about whether
she accepts or refuses.

263
00:34:03,233 --> 00:34:06,442
Similarly, if you feel like playing
the instrument in front of you,...

264
00:34:06,442 --> 00:34:11,608
just pick it up and play it;
do not worry about being good or bad,

265
00:34:12,317 --> 00:34:16,733
Just listen to your heart
and do what it says.

266
00:34:21,608 --> 00:34:26,692
Now carefully look at that gate.
it’s the gate you look at every day.

267
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:33,192
it’s the gate you guys
can never cross.

268
00:34:33,983 --> 00:34:36,983
Look at that gate again and imagine.

269
00:34:36,983 --> 00:34:43,275
That the girl you truly love,
is standing behind that gate...

270
00:34:46,192 --> 00:34:51,275
waiting for you...
calling out to you!

271
00:35:21,358 --> 00:35:26,150
Yes, yes! She's calling out to you!

272
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:29,358
She's asking you to come and
break down that gate,...

273
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:34,442
so that it never closes again.

274
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:39,650
She's not going to wait forever!
Listen to your heart.!

275
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:41,942
Go on! Get up and break
open that gate!

276
00:35:41,942 --> 00:35:46,233
C'mon! Just listen to your heart
Get up! And get going!

277
00:35:46,442 --> 00:35:47,733
Go on...!

278
00:36:19,275 --> 00:36:22,108
There is so much of hatred
in this world.

279
00:36:22,108 --> 00:36:23,983
Even then, the hearts are full of love.

280
00:36:23,983 --> 00:36:26,192
Go forth and tell this universe,...

281
00:36:26,192 --> 00:36:31,067
Nothing can stop these love stories.

282
00:37:19,817 --> 00:37:24,817
''I stop in mid-walk''

283
00:37:24,817 --> 00:37:28,942
''Left to myself I am lost''

284
00:37:29,942 --> 00:37:35,108
''And midway, I lose my words''

285
00:37:35,108 --> 00:37:39,692
''Is this love?''

286
00:37:39,692 --> 00:37:44,025
''Yes, this is love''

287
00:39:24,608 --> 00:39:28,608
''Why do I die to see you?''

288
00:39:29,317 --> 00:39:34,108
''l don't know''

289
00:39:34,317 --> 00:39:38,483
''Why do I do what I do?''

290
00:39:39,275 --> 00:39:43,483
''l don't know''

291
00:39:44,192 --> 00:39:51,692
''l try sometimes, to make my way
through blind alleys''

292
00:39:54,192 --> 00:39:59,067
''Everything in the world
seems to startle me''

293
00:40:04,067 --> 00:40:08,358
''Oh, what is this doing to me?''

294
00:40:08,358 --> 00:40:12,942
''Is this love?''

295
00:40:13,067 --> 00:40:17,067
''Yes, this is love''

296
00:41:53,067 --> 00:41:57,650
''In the way you are...''

297
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:02,733
''there's something very naughty''

298
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:12,525
''In the way you are...''

299
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:17,525
''there's something very naughty''

300
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:21,525
''On my lips...''

301
00:42:22,608 --> 00:42:26,525
''lingers something of a grievance''

302
00:42:27,608 --> 00:42:32,525
''l am kissing your eyes with mine...''

303
00:42:37,608 --> 00:42:42,192
''l hold you, I go into raptures''

304
00:42:47,317 --> 00:42:51,817
''Oh, what is this doing to me?''

305
00:42:51,817 --> 00:42:56,692
''Is this love?''

306
00:42:56,692 --> 00:43:01,692
''Yes, this is love''

307
00:44:11,108 --> 00:44:13,400
Mr. Aryan do you know
what you are asking for?

308
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,817
Have you forgotten the rules
of Gurukul?

309
00:44:15,817 --> 00:44:18,817
Please sir. Think about it
he has no other choice.

310
00:44:18,817 --> 00:44:21,900
Mr. Aryan, you are asking me to allow
a student of Gurukul...

311
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,025
to do a part time job.

312
00:44:24,025 --> 00:44:26,108
It's impossible!

313
00:44:26,108 --> 00:44:28,817
Sir, Samir's father has passed away.

314
00:44:28,817 --> 00:44:31,608
His mother works day and
night to support him.

315
00:44:31,608 --> 00:44:35,108
That’s why, he thinks by getting a job
he can share his mother's burden.

316
00:44:35,108 --> 00:44:40,192
And I think...we should help him out.

317
00:44:52,483 --> 00:44:55,692
You must be back before
10 every night.

318
00:44:55,692 --> 00:44:56,358
Yes sir!

319
00:45:13,775 --> 00:45:20,067
How can one live without love?
How can one die unloved?

320
00:45:25,858 --> 00:45:27,942
Sweeter than sugar!
Love, Love.

321
00:45:27,942 --> 00:45:29,858
More sour than tamarind.
Love, Love.

322
00:45:29,858 --> 00:45:35,233
This is love. Yes love, love.

323
00:45:37,942 --> 00:45:42,733
Oh, Kakeji, what happened
why did you stop?

324
00:45:43,817 --> 00:45:46,525
Preeto's come.

325
00:45:46,525 --> 00:45:51,733
You came close and smiled at me
You filled my life with sweet dreams...

326
00:45:54,525 --> 00:46:04,817
Now my heart doesn’t listen to me
What do I do, something happens to me,

327
00:46:26,775 --> 00:46:30,567
Oh Jaggi, Preeto's coming here.

328
00:46:30,567 --> 00:46:33,275
Yes.. but today she is coming...

329
00:46:33,275 --> 00:46:36,067
with a smile on her face
and not with her shoes in her hand.

330
00:46:36,067 --> 00:46:39,692
What are you saying!

331
00:46:39,692 --> 00:46:43,150
Excuse me . Kakeji
-One minute. Go away.

332
00:46:46,983 --> 00:46:49,942
Kakeji
-Yes ma'am?

333
00:46:49,942 --> 00:46:54,775
Something happens to you?
-Yes ma'am.

334
00:46:54,775 --> 00:46:58,942
Where?
-Here.

335
00:46:58,942 --> 00:47:03,442
To tell you the truth Kakeji
something happens to me too.

336
00:47:03,442 --> 00:47:06,025
Oh really.
-Oh yes

337
00:47:06,025 --> 00:47:11,233
Where?
-Here

338
00:47:13,942 --> 00:47:19,025
Kakeji, did you remember something?
-Yes ma'am, I remembered.

339
00:47:19,817 --> 00:47:24,817
So, now something happens to you?
-No ma'am, nothing happens.

340
00:47:24,817 --> 00:47:28,525
Jolly good!
-Very good ma'am.

341
00:47:28,525 --> 00:47:31,525
Eat sugar and die! Stupid...

342
00:47:31,525 --> 00:47:33,608
How many times have I told you
not to mess with me.

343
00:47:33,733 --> 00:47:37,900
Oh, this is love, love.
Love... love.

344
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:43,108
Ishika, Ishika!
Miss Monica is calling you!

345
00:47:58,275 --> 00:47:59,608
Did you call me Ma'am?

346
00:47:59,608 --> 00:48:03,692
Yes, Ishika come in
Your cousin Viren has come to see you.

347
00:48:05,275 --> 00:48:09,483
I told him that I do not like visitors
who do not take prior permission...

348
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:12,692
but I believe there is
some sort of urgency...

349
00:48:12,692 --> 00:48:18,067
so I have given him permission....

350
00:48:25,358 --> 00:48:28,650
Excuse me... You!

351
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:32,358
How have you been, quickly put
your arm around me otherwise..

352
00:48:32,358 --> 00:48:36,650
I will tell Miss Monica about your
morning visits to Gurukul.

353
00:48:41,567 --> 00:48:43,942
I am seeing you after
so many years

354
00:48:43,942 --> 00:48:49,150
and just look at how
you've really grown.

355
00:48:52,650 --> 00:48:55,525
Keep smiling, keep smiling,
that's lovely.

356
00:48:55,525 --> 00:48:59,442
Now you must be wondering what
the hell I am doing here, right....

357
00:48:59,442 --> 00:49:01,150
The thing is that Ishika,
ever since I’ve seen you

358
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:03,817
I see flashes of you all the time and

359
00:49:03,817 --> 00:49:06,525
you've even started coming
in my dreams now...

360
00:49:06,525 --> 00:49:10,733
and I am sure I must be in your
dreams too Right? I knew it...

361
00:49:11,108 --> 00:49:13,817
I feel we shouldn’t waste
any time now...

362
00:49:13,817 --> 00:49:16,233
There is no point just
looking at each other...

363
00:49:16,233 --> 00:49:20,192
and not saying anything to
one another...it’s so stupid?

364
00:49:20,192 --> 00:49:23,400
I feel we should take our
love story further.

365
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,400
So I will wait for you on Sunday...

366
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,108
at the Mall Road Coffee House
at 4 p.m.

367
00:49:28,108 --> 00:49:33,108
Just be there. Okay.
-Never.

368
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:54,192
Excuse me
My name is Karan, and yours?

369
00:49:54,192 --> 00:49:58,858
Hi! I'm Karan!
What did you say your name was?

370
00:50:00,567 --> 00:50:05,067
How do you end up hurting yourself
in the same place, all the time?

371
00:50:05,067 --> 00:50:06,483
Sorry, what?

372
00:50:06,483 --> 00:50:08,067
I asked
how do you end up...

373
00:50:08,067 --> 00:50:10,442
hurting yourself in the same place
all the time?

374
00:50:10,442 --> 00:50:15,775
I do not know, may be
my mind is elsewhere, these days.

375
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:20,942
Did you always want to be a doctor?
-I am not a doctor.

376
00:50:21,442 --> 00:50:25,942
Oh, so you are a nurse in this hospital.
-I do not work here.

377
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:29,442
My father had built this hospital...

378
00:50:29,442 --> 00:50:32,442
and he had left the decoration
of this room to me.

379
00:50:32,442 --> 00:50:36,650
Since then I just come here
to spend some time with these kids.

380
00:50:36,733 --> 00:50:40,442
So, what do you do?
-Nothing.

381
00:50:40,442 --> 00:50:45,525
Wow! I wish I could do nothing.

382
00:50:46,733 --> 00:50:51,233
Excuse me? I have been wanting
to ask you something....

383
00:50:51,233 --> 00:50:56,108
the other night I saw you at the
station you were standing all alone...

384
00:50:56,108 --> 00:50:59,817
the train came, and I turned to
look at you and you had walked away...

385
00:50:59,817 --> 00:51:04,108
I couldn’t understand anything
were you waiting for someone?

386
00:51:06,025 --> 00:51:09,608
lf you do not want to talk
about it it's ok, no problem.

387
00:51:12,608 --> 00:51:16,692
You saw the girl standing
at the station...

388
00:51:17,192 --> 00:51:20,692
but you did not see her
red bridal dress....

389
00:51:20,692 --> 00:51:25,067
the henna on her hands
the sindoor on her forehead...

390
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:31,775
It was Karva Chauth...
I was waiting for my husband.

391
00:51:50,358 --> 00:51:53,650
Hey Samir, come here.
What is happening....

392
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:57,442
why are girls and boys giving....
red and yellow flowers to one another?

393
00:51:57,442 --> 00:52:00,650
Kakeji, today is rose day.
-Rose day? You mean, ''flower'' Rose day.

394
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:01,358
Yes sir.

395
00:52:01,858 --> 00:52:05,942
I have heard about Republic day
independence day, Happy Birthday...

396
00:52:05,942 --> 00:52:09,358
what is this Rose day all about?
-It is a very special day sir.

397
00:52:09,358 --> 00:52:12,525
Today, you can give any girl a rose
and tell her what you feel for her...

398
00:52:12,525 --> 00:52:16,233
and she cannot refuse it.
-This is a very nice day.

399
00:52:16,233 --> 00:52:18,150
Definitely sir . see...

400
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:20,150
yellow rose is for friendship...
and red roses for love.

401
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:23,317
Hey, keep the yellow in your pocket...
I need only the red rose.

402
00:52:23,317 --> 00:52:25,317
Why do you leave all the
cleaning up to me...

403
00:52:25,317 --> 00:52:30,400
Navneet these days you are...

404
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:39,025
Preetoji, preetoji.
Never mind Kakeji, never mind.

405
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:45,108
Happy ''loose'' day ma'am.
-What?

406
00:52:45,108 --> 00:52:48,108
I mean . happy Rose day ma'am.
Happy rose day!

407
00:52:48,108 --> 00:52:48,608
Rose day?

408
00:52:49,108 --> 00:52:50,817
Yes ma'am .today is a
very special day.

409
00:52:50,817 --> 00:52:54,483
Today you will have to accept Kake's
rose today you cannot refuse me.

410
00:52:54,817 --> 00:52:59,983
Is that so?
-Yes ma'am . you can ask anyone.

411
00:53:00,108 --> 00:53:03,775
Oh no, Kakeji, why ask anyone since
you are saying today, is Rose day...

412
00:53:03,775 --> 00:53:06,692
why don't you put it with
your own hands.

413
00:53:06,692 --> 00:53:10,567
What?
-Yes

414
00:53:10,692 --> 00:53:12,858
Preetoji?
-Yes sir.

415
00:53:12,858 --> 00:53:15,692
You are really looking like my Juliet.

416
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:23,858
Oh my Romeo, on this occasion
I want to give you something special.

417
00:53:24,567 --> 00:53:28,650
So give it ma'am.
-Should l?

418
00:53:30,275 --> 00:53:32,067
So take this Eat sugar and
die...

419
00:53:32,067 --> 00:53:36,858
to hell with your rose day
do not mess with Preeto.

420
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:56,442
Forget friendship,
today, just say it.

421
00:54:08,608 --> 00:54:13,108
I have been waiting for you
for the past half an hour.

422
00:54:13,108 --> 00:54:16,525
What sorry Deepak. You just do
not care for anyone else's time.

423
00:54:16,525 --> 00:54:21,400
You see, I got late trying to
find you these beautiful flowers.

424
00:54:35,275 --> 00:54:40,400
Come on, I will introduce you to Samir.
.Who's that?

425
00:54:42,775 --> 00:54:47,067
Hi! Sanju, this is my girlfriend
whom I wanted you to meet...

426
00:54:47,692 --> 00:54:51,692
shocked you, didn’t l?
-Definitely, shocked me.

427
00:54:51,692 --> 00:54:55,983
Deepak, this is Samir...
my oldest and dearest friend...

428
00:54:56,692 --> 00:55:00,483
and Samir, this is Deepak
the love of my life.

429
00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:05,067
Nice to see you man.
Is this cafe yours?

430
00:55:05,067 --> 00:55:07,067
No, I work here.

431
00:55:07,067 --> 00:55:11,275
You mean to say you're a waiter here.
-Yes.

432
00:55:12,942 --> 00:55:15,275
Ok c'mon, come with us
we have come to take you ....

433
00:55:15,275 --> 00:55:16,942
we are going for a movie
with some friends.

434
00:55:16,942 --> 00:55:19,233
I cannot come Sanju,
I have got lots of work.

435
00:55:19,233 --> 00:55:21,942
C'mon Samir, you can take
leave for one day.

436
00:55:21,942 --> 00:55:26,442
No, I cannot . I have just joined here.

437
00:55:56,233 --> 00:55:59,400
So, what are you going to do now?

438
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:03,900
Nothing . I’ll just never
see her again...

439
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:10,692
never go in front of her
I’ll just forget her.

440
00:56:18,108 --> 00:56:21,608
You're on the right track.

441
00:56:21,608 --> 00:56:24,192
lf I’m not mistaken this is
the same girl for whom...

442
00:56:24,192 --> 00:56:27,067
you crossed the gate,
the other night, right.

443
00:56:27,067 --> 00:56:31,275
And today you want to forget her,
just because she loves someone else...

444
00:56:31,275 --> 00:56:35,067
very good .that’s really great.

445
00:56:35,067 --> 00:56:39,358
Excuse me sir, there are some people
who fall in love but their love...

446
00:56:39,358 --> 00:56:44,358
is not reciprocated everyone does not
have your kind of luck!

447
00:56:45,983 --> 00:56:50,358
I pray to God everyday Karan
that no one has my kind of luck...

448
00:56:50,775 --> 00:56:55,567
especially none of you.

449
00:56:56,358 --> 00:57:03,858
At least Samir loves someone who he
can see, whose laughter he can hear...

450
00:57:06,358 --> 00:57:08,442
I can't even do that.

451
00:57:08,442 --> 00:57:12,858
Why not Sir?

452
00:57:12,858 --> 00:57:17,733
Because the girl I love is no more.

453
00:57:20,650 --> 00:57:25,525
She's dead!

454
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,525
I did not fall in love with her
on the condition...

455
00:57:33,525 --> 00:57:34,817
that she would live longer than me...

456
00:57:34,817 --> 00:57:39,817
there are no conditions in love
so there shouldn’t be any regrets.

457
00:57:41,692 --> 00:57:49,317
So what if today she is not with me
I still love her the same way...

458
00:57:49,817 --> 00:57:56,900
not because I can't find someone else to
love, but loving her makes me happy.

459
00:57:59,108 --> 00:58:03,900
Whenever I miss her, I close my eyes
and she is with me.

460
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:12,775
You didn't fall in love with her on the
condition that she will love you too...

461
00:58:13,275 --> 00:58:17,775
so just because she loves someone
else you want to forget her,

462
00:58:20,983 --> 00:58:26,358
don't let go so easily.

463
00:58:28,567 --> 00:58:30,275
Love is just like life,

464
00:58:30,275 --> 00:58:34,650
it’s not always easy, and
it does not always bring happiness...

465
00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:41,442
but when we do not stop living
why should we stop loving!

466
00:58:45,233 --> 00:58:49,858
Sorry for the long lecture anyway if
Mr. Narayan Shankar sees you'll here...

467
00:58:50,358 --> 00:58:55,733
then all the love stories will come
to an end today itself.

468
00:59:01,733 --> 00:59:03,817
Love is just like life its
not always easy...

469
00:59:03,817 --> 00:59:08,442
and it does not always
bring happiness.

470
00:59:08,442 --> 00:59:13,900
But when we do not stop living
why should we stop loving.

471
00:59:25,025 --> 00:59:30,400
Made you wait for a long time?

472
01:00:34,650 --> 01:00:39,233
This is for hugging me that day I know
what guys like you are all about...

473
01:00:39,733 --> 01:00:44,733
but this time you have messed
with the wrong girl.

474
01:00:44,733 --> 01:00:47,233
My name is ISHlKA DHANRAJGlR...

475
01:00:47,233 --> 01:00:51,233
and I can employ hundred boys
like you as servants in my house.

476
01:00:51,233 --> 01:00:59,108
So next time, before fooling around
with any girl remember this slap and me.

477
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:32,192
By slapping me you have
taught me a lesson.

478
01:01:33,858 --> 01:01:37,858
But ma'am this really was
my first time

479
01:01:37,858 --> 01:01:41,150
and I was unaware of
the rules of this game.

480
01:01:41,150 --> 01:01:46,858
I did not know one had to exchange one's
bank accounts before asking a girl out.

481
01:01:48,858 --> 01:01:52,650
lf I knew this, I would have introduced
myself much earlier to you...

482
01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:54,650
my name is Vikram Oberoi,

483
01:01:54,650 --> 01:01:57,650
and my father is one of the leading
industrialists of this nation...

484
01:01:57,650 --> 01:02:03,442
and if he wants he can employ your
father but I am so stupid...

485
01:02:03,858 --> 01:02:08,025
I was not aware of the
importance of all this.

486
01:02:08,733 --> 01:02:11,942
I just knew that I had seen a
beautiful girl...

487
01:02:11,942 --> 01:02:18,817
whom I wanted to get to know,
and become friends with.

488
01:02:20,025 --> 01:02:24,525
I thought this was enough to ask someone
out for a date. How stupid I was...

489
01:02:24,942 --> 01:02:29,733
but now I have understood.
Next time I won't get slapped.

490
01:02:49,692 --> 01:02:56,483
You shut her up man, and I was not aware
that my friend is the son of a rich man.

491
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:01,400
What do you think
if I was the son of such a rich man...

492
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:03,567
would I be a waiter's friend?
-What? What do you mean?

493
01:03:03,567 --> 01:03:06,192
My dad works in a bank.
-What?

494
01:03:06,192 --> 01:03:09,067
Then .what was all this?

495
01:03:09,067 --> 01:03:10,983
I had to shut the rich girl up...

496
01:03:10,983 --> 01:03:14,775
so I just made myself richer
than her, and she shut up.

497
01:03:15,067 --> 01:03:19,775
Ok, forget this .tell me
are all beautiful girls this snooty?

498
01:03:20,650 --> 01:03:25,483
Well since they're beautiful
they are bound to be a little proud.

499
01:03:26,567 --> 01:03:30,275
Not at all, she is very sweet.
-Then she must be very ugly.

500
01:03:37,650 --> 01:03:42,567
I had seen Kiran for the first time
on this very platform.

501
01:03:42,942 --> 01:03:45,150
She had just got married and come...

502
01:03:45,150 --> 01:03:50,942
and it was also the last time
I saw her happy...

503
01:03:51,525 --> 01:03:55,817
because her husband had to leave
that very night...

504
01:03:56,233 --> 01:04:05,025
due to some tension at the border,
and he was an Air force pilot.

505
01:04:12,108 --> 01:04:15,817
Since then she often comes here...

506
01:04:15,817 --> 01:04:23,317
hoping to see her husband
get down from the train...

507
01:04:23,817 --> 01:04:28,483
but everybody knows that is impossible
because two years back we got to hear..

508
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:31,608
that two planes were found
missing at the border.

509
01:04:31,608 --> 01:04:35,900
I feel even she knows
that her husband is no more...

510
01:04:36,483 --> 01:04:42,400
but she still comes here to please
one man her husband’s father .

511
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:46,900
Major General Khanna...

512
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:51,067
a retired army officer and one of the
richest men in this town who believes...

513
01:04:51,067 --> 01:04:55,775
that till he does not see the dead body
of his son, he is not dead ...

514
01:04:56,567 --> 01:05:03,858
he insists that Kiran dutifully fulfills
all the traditions of a married girl.

515
01:05:04,983 --> 01:05:10,150
Kiran's sister-in-law, Nandini,
is her only friend.

516
01:05:10,567 --> 01:05:15,150
She is the wife of
Major Khanna's elder son...

517
01:05:15,650 --> 01:05:20,358
who is a computer engineer in the
military and is away most of the time.

518
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:25,150
Nandini loves Kiran like a sister
and wants to see her happy.

519
01:05:26,150 --> 01:05:29,525
She has a naughty son named Ayush.

520
01:05:29,525 --> 01:05:32,942
He is the bright light in
Kiran's dark life...

521
01:05:32,942 --> 01:05:38,233
they laugh, cry, play
and fight together.

522
01:05:38,650 --> 01:05:43,317
Kiran forgets all her pains and sorrows
and she becomes a child with him.

523
01:05:43,942 --> 01:05:48,442
She is after all just 19 years old.

524
01:05:49,025 --> 01:05:54,317
This is Kiran .who had had come here
to laugh and love...

525
01:05:54,733 --> 01:05:58,900
hope she gets her share of happiness.

526
01:05:59,525 --> 01:06:04,525
I promise you Khan Baba she will
definitely get her share of happiness.

527
01:06:27,567 --> 01:06:32,275
What exactly are you doing?
-The same thing that you are doing sir.

528
01:06:32,692 --> 01:06:35,692
I am doing Suryanamaskar.

529
01:06:35,692 --> 01:06:40,567
So am l. It’s just that you do it
your way and I do it my way.

530
01:06:47,358 --> 01:06:51,775
I wanted to ask you,
why do you do it.

531
01:06:52,358 --> 01:06:57,233
It makes we feel good to stare
directly at the sun...

532
01:06:57,567 --> 01:06:59,942
without having to blink my eyes.

533
01:06:59,942 --> 01:07:06,525
I feel I am not weaker than the sun.
I like it .why do you do it?

534
01:07:06,942 --> 01:07:08,358
Just like that sir, unlike you,

535
01:07:08,358 --> 01:07:10,525
I do not have a battle
going on with the sun..

536
01:07:10,525 --> 01:07:14,817
I just enjoy basking in the sunshine
I call this suryanamaskar.

537
01:07:16,817 --> 01:07:21,608
Excuse me sir
I wanted to ask you for something.

538
01:07:22,233 --> 01:07:22,442
Yes.

539
01:07:23,608 --> 01:07:25,608
Sir, I do not know if you are aware
that today is the festival of Holi...

540
01:07:25,608 --> 01:07:27,817
and I wanted the students
to celebrate it.

541
01:07:27,817 --> 01:07:31,817
But I have been told that Holi has
never been celebrated here in Gurukul.

542
01:07:32,233 --> 01:07:36,400
Holi has never been celebrated here
for the simple reason that....

543
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:39,192
no one has ever wanted to
at least no one has asked me before.

544
01:07:39,192 --> 01:07:43,608
Sir, no one has asked you because
everybody is scared of you.

545
01:07:43,608 --> 01:07:47,400
And you are not scared of
me Mr. Aryan?

546
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:54,192
No sir, I have never been scared of
doing the right thing, so as long as...

547
01:07:54,608 --> 01:07:59,192
I know that I am not asking for
anything wrong, I am not scared.

548
01:07:59,775 --> 01:08:04,567
Holi has never been and never will be
celebrated inside Gurukul, however...

549
01:08:04,983 --> 01:08:07,900
I have nothing against
this festival,

550
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:09,192
if some of the students
wish to celebrate....

551
01:08:09,192 --> 01:08:13,775
they can go outside Gurukul
and do so.

552
01:08:27,483 --> 01:08:31,567
From where I come there is
a tradition of starting this day...

553
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:36,150
with putting a teeka on the
eldest of the family...

554
01:08:36,150 --> 01:08:39,442
if you do not mind, on behalf of....

555
01:08:39,442 --> 01:08:45,442
me and my students I would like
to put this on you.

556
01:08:45,858 --> 01:08:50,025
I’ll just put a little sir,

557
01:10:05,275 --> 01:10:09,775
''O' golden-eyed one...''

558
01:10:10,150 --> 01:10:15,442
''whether you give me your heart,
or whether you chide me''

559
01:10:25,025 --> 01:10:29,525
''We're crazy about you''

560
01:10:29,525 --> 01:10:33,942
''We're your playful paramours''

561
01:10:48,942 --> 01:10:53,733
''You liars''

562
01:10:53,733 --> 01:10:58,025
''Behind that innocent face,
there's hidden a black heart''

563
01:11:13,317 --> 01:11:18,692
''They will break every heart''

564
01:12:17,150 --> 01:12:19,317
''Go on lass''

565
01:12:19,317 --> 01:12:22,108
''Do what you will''

566
01:12:22,108 --> 01:12:26,733
''I’ve tainted you all over''

567
01:12:26,733 --> 01:12:29,317
''Hey you...''

568
01:12:29,317 --> 01:12:31,733
''l swear...''

569
01:12:31,733 --> 01:12:36,608
''I’m going to have you spiked''

570
01:12:36,608 --> 01:12:41,317
''I’ll climb the spike for you.
Just tell me, I’ll die right now''

571
01:12:41,317 --> 01:12:43,400
''Shock me if you can''

572
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:45,817
''And I’m all yours''

573
01:12:45,817 --> 01:12:47,983
''Remember my words''

574
01:12:47,983 --> 01:12:50,817
''Someday, two hearts will meet''

575
01:12:50,817 --> 01:12:55,483
''We're crazy about you''

576
01:12:55,608 --> 01:13:00,775
''We're playful paramours''

577
01:13:00,775 --> 01:13:05,275
''These Romeos are ruinous''

578
01:13:05,275 --> 01:13:09,567
''They will break every heart''

579
01:14:08,233 --> 01:14:13,108
''Why are you standing off?''

580
01:14:13,108 --> 01:14:16,608
''Are you on a high?''

581
01:14:18,108 --> 01:14:22,192
''Why are you standing off?
You're so close to my heart''

582
01:14:23,108 --> 01:14:27,400
''Embrace me. Just find an excuse''

583
01:14:30,317 --> 01:14:34,900
''Is it the standoff
which sends you on a high?''

584
01:14:35,275 --> 01:14:39,400
''lf you're calling me,
here I come''

585
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:42,400
''You should've thought
before taking the leap''

586
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:45,483
''Now that you've come,
don't go away''

587
01:14:45,483 --> 01:14:49,900
''We're crazy about you''

588
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:54,775
''We're playful paramours''

589
01:14:55,192 --> 01:14:59,483
''These Romeos are ruinous''

590
01:14:59,483 --> 01:15:04,775
''They will break every heart''

591
01:15:48,608 --> 01:15:52,817
''Be there sorrow, or come joy''

592
01:15:53,317 --> 01:15:57,817
''The easterly still blows''

593
01:15:58,025 --> 01:16:02,817
''One comes, one goes...''

594
01:16:03,108 --> 01:16:07,900
''why are you holding
your heart back?''

595
01:16:08,192 --> 01:16:13,775
''I’m not holding my heart back;
my heart holds me back''

596
01:16:17,775 --> 01:16:25,192
''Will someone tell me, what's
the truth, what a mirage is...?''

597
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:29,192
''Everything in the world...''

598
01:16:29,192 --> 01:16:31,483
''is so lovely''

599
01:16:31,483 --> 01:16:34,192
''That's the only truth''

600
01:16:34,192 --> 01:16:37,358
''Aren't the colors lively?''

601
01:16:37,358 --> 01:16:41,775
''We're crazy about you''

602
01:16:41,775 --> 01:16:46,650
''We're playful paramours''

603
01:16:47,275 --> 01:16:51,358
''These Romeos are ruinous''

604
01:16:51,358 --> 01:16:56,567
''They will break every heart''

605
01:16:56,567 --> 01:17:01,150
''O' golden-eyed one...''

606
01:17:01,233 --> 01:17:06,233
''either give me your heart,
or chide me''

607
01:17:06,233 --> 01:17:10,650
''You liars''

608
01:17:10,650 --> 01:17:14,817
''Behind that innocent face,
there's hidden a black heart''

609
01:17:16,233 --> 01:17:20,733
''We're crazy about you''

610
01:17:20,733 --> 01:17:25,608
''We're playful paramours''

611
01:17:25,942 --> 01:17:30,400
''These Romeos are ruinous''

612
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:35,733
''They will break every heart''

613
01:17:35,817 --> 01:17:40,025
''I’m crazy about you''

614
01:17:40,025 --> 01:17:44,692
''I’m your playful paramour''

615
01:17:44,692 --> 01:17:49,317
''These Romeos are ruinous''

616
01:17:49,317 --> 01:17:54,692
''They will break every heart''

617
01:18:57,650 --> 01:19:02,442
My friends think that I was
very rude to you at the cafe...

618
01:19:02,817 --> 01:19:05,817
the other day and I must apologize.

619
01:19:05,817 --> 01:19:09,817
Oh! And what do you think?

620
01:19:09,817 --> 01:19:15,025
I think they are right. I am sorry.

621
01:19:15,817 --> 01:19:19,108
My friends think that you were
in the wrong too,

622
01:19:19,108 --> 01:19:21,608
and you should also apologize.

623
01:19:21,608 --> 01:19:24,108
Oh! And what do you think?

624
01:19:24,108 --> 01:19:28,400
I think they are right.

625
01:19:29,608 --> 01:19:32,108
Good. Now we are quits.

626
01:19:32,108 --> 01:19:35,983
Oh no, we are not.
-Why not?

627
01:19:35,983 --> 01:19:40,900
Because that day you slapped me
and I have still not hit you.

628
01:19:41,275 --> 01:19:45,400
So, you want to slap me?

629
01:19:46,067 --> 01:19:48,692
You want to hit a girl?

630
01:19:48,692 --> 01:19:53,358
Well if the girl insists on
quitting things, what can I do.

631
01:19:53,858 --> 01:19:59,067
Alright, I want to finish this,
once and for all.

632
01:19:59,275 --> 01:20:04,567
Hit me. Come on hit me.

633
01:20:14,358 --> 01:20:19,650
Actually, let it be,
my hands will get dirty.

634
01:20:20,067 --> 01:20:25,442
my friends were totally wrong
about you and I was right.

635
01:20:42,442 --> 01:20:44,942
You . how come you are here?

636
01:20:44,942 --> 01:20:46,608
I have come to tell you something

637
01:20:46,608 --> 01:20:47,442
Tell me?

638
01:20:48,442 --> 01:20:52,233
Yes, but before that you will have to
promise me that you won't get angry.

639
01:20:52,233 --> 01:20:54,900
Ok, I won't.

640
01:20:54,900 --> 01:21:00,608
I found out everything about your life
about why you go to the station...

641
01:21:01,025 --> 01:21:06,108
about your husband,
Major Khanna, everything.

642
01:21:06,108 --> 01:21:10,108
I was brought up with the belief
that boys are the tough ones...

643
01:21:10,108 --> 01:21:14,983
...and girls are weak, but you made
me realize how untrue it is.

644
01:21:15,108 --> 01:21:19,483
You are very different from other girls
and it would make me proud if we...

645
01:21:19,900 --> 01:21:24,275
could be friends, you promised me
that you will not get angry.

646
01:21:27,483 --> 01:21:31,983
I am not angry . it’s just that...

647
01:21:33,775 --> 01:21:37,858
I am not used to hearing
nice things about myself.

648
01:21:37,858 --> 01:21:39,858
I am a married girl,

649
01:21:39,858 --> 01:21:43,567
living in a small town here a boy
and a girl can never be friends...

650
01:21:43,567 --> 01:21:48,358
it is considered wrong, and I do not
have the strength to prove it right.

651
01:21:50,775 --> 01:21:56,650
You overestimated me,
I’m not that strong.

652
01:21:58,650 --> 01:22:02,650
Who are you and me to decide
what is wrong and right?

653
01:22:02,650 --> 01:22:06,650
That’s his job, let’s leave it to him.

654
01:22:06,942 --> 01:22:10,942
We can only follow our hearts
that’s exactly what I am doing...

655
01:22:10,942 --> 01:22:15,525
now it’s your turn .
if your heart says that...

656
01:22:15,942 --> 01:22:19,817
...this is right then put
your hand forward...

657
01:22:19,817 --> 01:22:25,442
otherwise walk away, and I promise
I'll never come in your way.

658
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:39,900
Hi! My name is Karan.
And yours ma'am?

659
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:43,900
Friends are not addressed
as ma'am. I am Kiran.

660
01:22:43,900 --> 01:22:49,317
Great, let’s go.
.Hey! At least do your prayers.

661
01:22:49,692 --> 01:22:53,900
No need, my prayers are done.
Let’s leave.

662
01:22:55,608 --> 01:22:59,692
I don't believe this Samir
can't you find yourself a decent job?

663
01:22:59,692 --> 01:23:03,483
Sanju, who is going to give
a student a part time job here?

664
01:23:03,483 --> 01:23:06,775
And in any case, my mother says
that no work is big or small...

665
01:23:06,775 --> 01:23:09,900
as long as you do it
with all your heart.

666
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:15,275
Okay, okay, stop giving me a lecture.
-I can't see Tom uncle, where is he?

667
01:23:15,692 --> 01:23:17,692
Don't ask.
-Why?

668
01:23:17,692 --> 01:23:20,983
For the past three hours
he has locked himself in the room...

669
01:23:20,983 --> 01:23:22,483
opening all the old trunks and
whenever...

670
01:23:22,483 --> 01:23:26,650
I ask him for a reason,
he does not answer.

671
01:23:36,567 --> 01:23:40,567
Papa, what are you doing?

672
01:23:40,567 --> 01:23:44,733
I can see that, but why are you
wearing this prehistoric costume.

673
01:23:46,150 --> 01:23:49,025
Because I am going for a
date with Jenny.

674
01:23:49,025 --> 01:23:52,150
Jenny aunty is going out with you.

675
01:23:52,150 --> 01:23:56,525
Yes sir, after six months of wooing
her she has finally agreed.

676
01:23:56,942 --> 01:23:59,942
But you never wear a suit
so why today?

677
01:23:59,942 --> 01:24:02,108
You see, Jenny likes
classy gentlemen...

678
01:24:02,108 --> 01:24:06,108
that’s why I thought
I’ll impress her with the suit.

679
01:24:06,108 --> 01:24:07,025
How am I looking.

680
01:24:07,025 --> 01:24:09,400
You are not looking good at all
Remove this.

681
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:10,400
What are you saying?

682
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:13,317
This was your mothers favorite
suit, wasn't it, tell me?

683
01:24:13,317 --> 01:24:15,317
Papa, that was twenty years ago.

684
01:24:15,317 --> 01:24:18,025
So what, does a suit change in
twenty years. What say Samir.

685
01:24:18,025 --> 01:24:21,900
I think you are looking
terrific Uncle. Smashing, superb

686
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:23,900
He does not know anything
you are not looking nice...

687
01:24:23,900 --> 01:24:25,983
and you are not going out
like this, understood.

688
01:24:25,983 --> 01:24:31,317
I am going my love . bye bye Samir

689
01:24:51,983 --> 01:24:58,567
Relax uncle, Sanju just talks rubbish.
Would you like some chips?

690
01:24:58,983 --> 01:25:03,275
Lift your arms up.

691
01:25:19,733 --> 01:25:26,025
One should love you, the way you are,
Not the way she wants you to be...

692
01:25:26,525 --> 01:25:32,442
lf someone tries to change you
then it’s not love but a compromise...

693
01:25:33,525 --> 01:25:38,525
And darling, one doesn't
compromise in love, right.

694
01:25:56,108 --> 01:26:00,817
Me and you locked in a room.

695
01:26:00,817 --> 01:26:04,525
Samir, have you gone mad
Samir behave yourself.

696
01:26:04,525 --> 01:26:05,900
And the key gets lost.

697
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:09,192
I’ll be back from the conference by
tomorrow morning, make sure that...

698
01:26:09,192 --> 01:26:14,483
everything is alright in Gurukul.
-Yes sir.

699
01:26:17,692 --> 01:26:22,067
Morning Mr. Aryan, what changes would
you like to make in Gurukul today.

700
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:26,400
Just a small change sir
I would like you to begin the day...

701
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:30,567
with some sweets . Today is
my birthday.

702
01:26:30,858 --> 01:26:33,567
Congratulations Mr. Aryan.

703
01:26:33,567 --> 01:26:37,567
I'm sorry I am not allowed
to have sweets...

704
01:26:37,567 --> 01:26:42,483
Actually sir, there was something
I wanted to ask you for.

705
01:26:42,983 --> 01:26:48,275
I knew you would ask me for something
tell me what can I do for you.

706
01:26:48,567 --> 01:26:50,942
Sir, I was thinking of throwing a
small party for the students...

707
01:26:50,942 --> 01:26:55,150
they have given me so much respect
in such a small span of time.

708
01:26:55,150 --> 01:27:00,567
I will be very happy to do something
for them sir . only if you permit.

709
01:27:04,525 --> 01:27:08,733
Alright Mr. Aryan.
You can have the party.

710
01:27:09,025 --> 01:27:10,858
But make sure that you
do not do anything...

711
01:27:10,858 --> 01:27:14,442
...that will spoil the reputation
of Gurukul.

712
01:27:15,317 --> 01:27:19,025
One more small request sir.

713
01:27:19,025 --> 01:27:20,817
Now what Mr. Aryan!

714
01:27:20,942 --> 01:27:23,525
Sir, most of the students
are learning music...

715
01:27:23,525 --> 01:27:28,233
...so I thought it would be really
nice to have a dance party.

716
01:27:28,233 --> 01:27:30,608
I was wondering if I could invite
our neighbors,

717
01:27:30,608 --> 01:27:34,525
Miss Monica's girls to join us...
that is only if you permit sir.

718
01:27:34,525 --> 01:27:37,608
Till today girls have never
entered Gurukul Mr. Aryan...

719
01:27:37,608 --> 01:27:42,692
and I would like to maintain
that tradition.

720
01:27:43,192 --> 01:27:48,483
You are right sir, but we really cannot
have a dance party without girls sir...

721
01:27:48,483 --> 01:27:52,608
and actually sir
I have sort of promised the boys.

722
01:27:52,608 --> 01:27:57,483
Before making the promise
you should have asked me Mr. Aryan!

723
01:27:57,775 --> 01:28:03,275
You know I don't like changes.
Come on Ram Singh.

724
01:29:57,575 --> 01:30:00,867
''There was this infatuated girl...''

725
01:30:00,867 --> 01:30:04,575
''who loved a boy to death''

726
01:30:04,575 --> 01:30:06,575
''Her eyes downcast...''

727
01:30:06,575 --> 01:30:08,575
''she blushed...''

728
01:30:08,575 --> 01:30:11,367
''as she traipsed down the alley''

729
01:30:11,367 --> 01:30:16,367
''On the sly, she'd pen
her love letters''

730
01:30:18,158 --> 01:30:23,658
''Was it something she wished to say?
Oh, but whom was she afraid of?''

731
01:30:23,950 --> 01:30:29,325
''And whenever we met,
she'd ask me...''

732
01:30:29,325 --> 01:30:32,033
''How does love happen?''

733
01:30:32,033 --> 01:30:35,325
''How does this love happen?''

734
01:30:35,325 --> 01:30:39,242
''All I could tell her was...''

735
01:30:43,725 --> 01:30:47,808
''Whether your eyes
are open or shut...''

736
01:30:51,433 --> 01:30:56,308
''you will always dream
of your loved one''

737
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:03,517
''Oh how do I tell you, my love...?''

738
01:31:03,517 --> 01:31:08,808
''How love happens''

739
01:33:12,058 --> 01:33:16,892
''Today, let's see what dying
for someone is like''

740
01:33:19,767 --> 01:33:25,850
''Let's see how love happens''

741
01:33:27,683 --> 01:33:33,142
''l was lost thinking of someone
when I wove my dreams''

742
01:33:35,475 --> 01:33:42,267
''l was lost in someone's arms
when I fell in love with him''

743
01:33:51,142 --> 01:33:58,225
''When you're in love,
you're never awake, nor asleep''

744
01:33:58,850 --> 01:34:04,308
''Oh how do I tell you, my love,
how love happens?''

745
01:35:10,058 --> 01:35:15,767
''Or is this some spell
that binds you?''

746
01:35:17,933 --> 01:35:23,850
''A thousand hurdles
the heart will overcome''

747
01:35:25,558 --> 01:35:31,142
''Far up, somewhere in the Heavens,
all this is decided''

748
01:35:33,517 --> 01:35:40,225
''Who knows when, how, one will meet
the fellow traveller''

749
01:35:48,933 --> 01:35:56,225
''The name that's writ on the heart
is the one you will fall for''

750
01:35:56,725 --> 01:36:03,892
''Oh how do I tell you, my love,
how love happens?''

751
01:36:12,892 --> 01:36:16,308
''Whether your eyes
are open or shut...''

752
01:36:16,308 --> 01:36:21,308
''you will always dream
of your loved one''

753
01:36:28,475 --> 01:36:34,183
''Oh how do I tell you, my love,
how love happens?''

754
01:40:00,475 --> 01:40:04,058
You will have to leave Mr. Aryan!

755
01:40:08,850 --> 01:40:14,767
I am sorry that this had to happen,
because I had started liking you.

756
01:40:15,975 --> 01:40:19,267
I thought that in spite of your
different ideas...

757
01:40:19,267 --> 01:40:22,058
and nontraditional methods
you could...

758
01:40:22,058 --> 01:40:26,642
become an important part of Gurukul
but I was wrong.

759
01:40:30,225 --> 01:40:33,933
My first instinct about
you was correct...

760
01:40:33,933 --> 01:40:38,225
you are a very arrogant and
undisciplined man...

761
01:40:38,642 --> 01:40:42,308
and we do not need people
like you here.

762
01:40:42,933 --> 01:40:47,642
I want your resignation on my table
first thing in the morning.

763
01:40:54,433 --> 01:40:59,725
Why the sniggering Mr. Aryan?

764
01:41:01,017 --> 01:41:05,392
I’m sorry sir! Till today,
I had a lot of respect for you

765
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:10,808
-I thought you were a very
intelligent...

766
01:41:11,100 --> 01:41:15,683
and sharp man . a man who would
never miss ...

767
01:41:15,683 --> 01:41:18,892
anything but I am afraid
I am disappointed.

768
01:41:18,892 --> 01:41:23,267
What are you trying to say Mr. Aryan?

769
01:41:23,267 --> 01:41:27,767
Do you remember sir,
when I first came here for a job,

770
01:41:27,767 --> 01:41:31,683
I told you my name . Raj Aryan...

771
01:41:31,683 --> 01:41:35,975
today I am going to tell you
my full name...

772
01:41:36,892 --> 01:41:42,350
Mr. Shankar, my full name is
Raj A Malhotra.

773
01:41:57,142 --> 01:42:01,433
Yes, I am the same Raj Malhotra...

774
01:42:03,933 --> 01:42:09,142
who had dared to fall in
love with your daughter...

775
01:42:09,142 --> 01:42:15,725
the same Raj Malhotra whom your
daughter loved very much...

776
01:42:16,142 --> 01:42:20,225
the same Raj Malhotra whom you hated so
much that you threw him out of Gurukul.

777
01:42:20,225 --> 01:42:25,517
without even seeing his face without
even giving him a chance to meet you...

778
01:42:26,225 --> 01:42:31,725
without even hearing what
he had to say.

779
01:42:34,808 --> 01:42:37,433
The same Raj Malhotra who could not get

780
01:42:37,517 --> 01:42:39,892
...admission in any other educational
institution...

781
01:42:39,892 --> 01:42:45,808
who could not get a decent job anywhere
but he worked on his own...

782
01:42:48,392 --> 01:42:50,683
and today the country's most
prestigious...

783
01:42:50,683 --> 01:42:52,892
...educational institution has
employed him.

784
01:42:52,892 --> 01:42:57,183
Yes sir, the same man who promised...

785
01:42:57,183 --> 01:43:02,183
to destroy me has welcomed
me with open arms.

786
01:43:05,683 --> 01:43:10,975
And as far as my resignation goes
I am sorry, I cannot.

787
01:43:13,183 --> 01:43:17,475
I have a contract in my hand which
clearly states that...

788
01:43:18,683 --> 01:43:23,558
I cannot leave or be expelled...

789
01:43:23,975 --> 01:43:28,642
till the end of the term .
signed Narayan Shankar.

790
01:43:30,850 --> 01:43:35,558
And Mr. Narayan Shankar .
by the time this term is over...

791
01:43:35,933 --> 01:43:41,767
I promise you that Gurukul will
not be the same.

792
01:43:46,558 --> 01:43:54,142
I loved only one woman all my life
and I will love her forever.

793
01:43:55,725 --> 01:44:01,433
She gave up her life for you, believing
that it would make you kinder...

794
01:44:01,808 --> 01:44:06,808
and bring love into this place and
that everything would change.

795
01:44:08,225 --> 01:44:11,225
You denied me of my only love and...

796
01:44:11,225 --> 01:44:16,517
this is a truth that I will have
to live with all my life.

797
01:44:18,017 --> 01:44:23,517
But there is one more truth that
I cannot live with...

798
01:44:23,892 --> 01:44:32,808
and that is the fact that the
girl I loved died in vain.

799
01:44:35,183 --> 01:44:39,892
The fact that nothing has changed here
that I cannot bear to live with.

800
01:44:46,767 --> 01:44:53,975
I promise you Mr. Shankar,
by the time I leave...

801
01:44:54,475 --> 01:44:57,892
I will fill this place with so much
love that ...

802
01:44:57,892 --> 01:45:02,683
it will take you ten lifetimes
to remove it.

803
01:45:03,058 --> 01:45:05,850
I will fill this place with so
much sunshine....

804
01:45:05,850 --> 01:45:12,142
that a man who has been staring at the
sun for 50 years, will have to blink.

805
01:45:15,058 --> 01:45:19,433
What happened to us will
not happen to anyone else.

806
01:45:28,142 --> 01:45:32,350
This I promise.

807
01:45:51,725 --> 01:45:56,600
''Even after the lovers have died...''

808
01:45:56,600 --> 01:46:01,808
''after their beloveds
have perished...''

809
01:46:01,808 --> 01:46:06,892
''their loves live on, forever

810
01:46:06,892 --> 01:46:12,100
''Their loves live on, forever''

811
01:48:02,975 --> 01:48:07,100
Today’s newspaper and your tea
both are kept next to your chair.

812
01:48:07,100 --> 01:48:10,892
I had made the tea ten minutes
back so it’s already cold,

813
01:48:10,892 --> 01:48:12,392
just the way you like.

814
01:48:12,392 --> 01:48:13,767
I am leaving early for college
today but...

815
01:48:13,767 --> 01:48:16,058
I have told Bahadur for your
breakfast...

816
01:48:16,058 --> 01:48:20,267
and I have also given your clothes
for ironing . and by the way...

817
01:48:20,683 --> 01:48:25,767
today is my birthday
you can wish me if you want.

818
01:48:27,767 --> 01:48:32,975
I forgot once again. Come here.

819
01:48:48,350 --> 01:48:51,350
I must be the world’s worst father.

820
01:48:51,350 --> 01:48:56,642
No, not at all you are the
best father in the world.

821
01:49:00,350 --> 01:49:01,808
Happy birthday my child.

822
01:49:01,808 --> 01:49:05,725
I pray that you get everything you
ever want,

823
01:49:05,725 --> 01:49:10,225
and all your dreams come true.

824
01:49:16,600 --> 01:49:19,600
Pretty, but still not as
beautiful as mom.

825
01:49:19,600 --> 01:49:21,225
Let me see.

826
01:49:21,225 --> 01:49:25,225
Oh it’s you, papa when did you come
I was just...

827
01:49:25,225 --> 01:49:29,517
Wait a minute, let’s see

828
01:49:39,392 --> 01:49:45,183
I think my daughter is more beautiful
than your mother. What do you think?

829
01:49:50,475 --> 01:49:54,475
Do you know ever since you were
a kid you have been wearing your....

830
01:49:54,475 --> 01:49:58,975
mother's mangalsutra and duppatta
and dressing up as a bride.

831
01:49:58,975 --> 01:50:03,975
I think now the time has
come to get you married.

832
01:50:05,350 --> 01:50:09,767
Stop it papa!
-Why?

833
01:50:09,767 --> 01:50:15,267
Hello, Hi. I am busy now
I 'll phone you later . ok ...bye!

834
01:50:17,558 --> 01:50:18,433
Who was that?

835
01:50:18,433 --> 01:50:21,767
That was Priya.
She keeps calling and boring me.

836
01:50:21,767 --> 01:50:27,558
Now you go change your clothes and
I will make you some hot coffee.

837
01:50:51,600 --> 01:50:56,600
Papa, papa
I have come to apologize to you.

838
01:50:57,892 --> 01:51:03,225
Apologize! For what?

839
01:51:04,600 --> 01:51:12,600
Papa, you always taught me
never to lie but I lied to you.

840
01:51:15,100 --> 01:51:19,600
That day when you were in my room
and the phone rang....

841
01:51:20,308 --> 01:51:26,475
I told you it was Priya but
it was not Priya papa .

842
01:51:27,183 --> 01:51:29,767
-it was someone else.

843
01:51:29,767 --> 01:51:33,475
Who was it?

844
01:51:33,475 --> 01:51:38,683
It was a boy.

845
01:51:38,975 --> 01:51:46,683
A boy whom I have known for a
very long time . someone who has...

846
01:51:47,142 --> 01:51:54,350
become much more than a friend
a boy who loves me very much...

847
01:51:57,350 --> 01:52:01,642
someone who I love very much.

848
01:52:03,558 --> 01:52:05,350
I know I should have told
you earlier...

849
01:52:05,350 --> 01:52:10,850
but I was scared that
you would get angry.

850
01:52:12,850 --> 01:52:17,642
You have always told me that love
leads to pain

851
01:52:21,808 --> 01:52:26,142
but I do not know what
it was about him...

852
01:52:26,142 --> 01:52:30,100
that I just could not stop myself.

853
01:52:30,600 --> 01:52:35,600
When you meet him you will
realize that how different he is,

854
01:52:37,600 --> 01:52:42,892
how sweet he is, how true he is.

855
01:52:44,225 --> 01:52:50,183
You had hoped that all
my dreams come true...

856
01:52:53,808 --> 01:53:00,183
he is my one and only dream and...

857
01:53:00,808 --> 01:53:06,100
after this I do not want anything else.
-What’s his name?

858
01:53:08,600 --> 01:53:13,558
Raj...Raj Malhotra.
-What does he do?

859
01:53:16,392 --> 01:53:20,558
He is a student in Gurukul.

860
01:53:25,183 --> 01:53:30,475
You are not angry no papa!
Papa, please don't be angry.

861
01:54:11,517 --> 01:54:13,017
I have come to tell you that...

862
01:54:13,017 --> 01:54:15,600
Raj Malhotra has been expelled
from Gurukul.

863
01:54:15,600 --> 01:54:21,517
I did not meet him, I do not know
what he looks like,

864
01:54:22,017 --> 01:54:26,683
and I hope I never see him.

865
01:54:26,683 --> 01:54:29,600
I have sent him somewhere
far away from here,

866
01:54:29,600 --> 01:54:34,392
and I would like you to forget him.

867
01:54:35,475 --> 01:54:43,475
I know you must be thinking that my
decision is cruel, and wrong...

868
01:54:44,100 --> 01:54:48,892
but I know that this is
the best thing for your future.

869
01:55:44,142 --> 01:55:48,308
Your tea is kept there but the
newspaper guy has still not come....

870
01:55:48,725 --> 01:55:53,433
Its Sunday, so I think he is
running a little late by the way...

871
01:55:53,725 --> 01:55:55,100
Bahadur is unwell.

872
01:55:55,100 --> 01:56:00,017
So let me know what you will have for
breakfast, I will make it myself.

873
01:56:08,100 --> 01:56:10,892
Are you alright?

874
01:56:10,892 --> 01:56:16,183
I am absolutely fine papa
I am absolutely fine.

875
01:56:19,308 --> 01:56:21,808
That’s enough, it’s quite late...

876
01:56:21,808 --> 01:56:27,267
and you have to get up early
in the morning . open your mouth.

877
01:56:39,183 --> 01:56:44,475
Do you know that you are
the world's best daughter.

878
01:56:46,183 --> 01:56:48,850
Are you happy?

879
01:56:48,850 --> 01:56:52,058
Are you happy, papa?
-Very much.

880
01:56:52,058 --> 01:56:56,267
Then I am also very happy.
Good night, papa.

881
01:57:33,808 --> 01:57:38,225
I’m sorry papa
I tried to forget him...

882
01:57:38,892 --> 01:57:42,225
I tried very hard not
to think about him...

883
01:57:42,225 --> 01:57:46,308
to stop loving him but
I just could not.

884
01:57:47,892 --> 01:57:51,308
I love you very much, papa and

885
01:57:51,308 --> 01:57:56,892
I can never hurt you,
but I love him too...

886
01:57:57,475 --> 01:58:02,600
and I cannot live without him.

887
01:58:02,600 --> 01:58:08,100
I hope someday you realize that
love is very beautiful...

888
01:58:08,392 --> 01:58:12,475
even if it comes with
a little pain.

889
01:59:33,017 --> 01:59:37,683
Ever since the day she told me
about you, I have hated you.

890
01:59:40,183 --> 01:59:45,475
I hated you so much that
I never wanted to see your face.

891
01:59:46,100 --> 01:59:50,392
I never ever wanted to hear
your voice...

892
01:59:50,392 --> 01:59:55,058
and today you are standing in
front of me on my doorstep.

893
01:59:55,058 --> 01:59:57,683
lf I want I can drag you out
of that gate...

894
01:59:57,683 --> 01:59:59,350
and throw you out of this place...

895
01:59:59,350 --> 02:00:06,183
and no piece of paper can stop me
but I am not going to do that...

896
02:00:06,642 --> 02:00:10,267
because now I want you to stay.

897
02:00:11,058 --> 02:00:21,267
You have given a 55 year old man a
reason to fight again .

898
02:00:21,850 --> 02:00:27,642
he has to prove all over again,
that for25 years whatever...

899
02:00:28,350 --> 02:00:32,725
he has stood for and believed in,
still holds true.

900
02:00:34,017 --> 02:00:39,850
You were right about me Mr. Aryan
like you even I love challenges.

901
02:00:44,808 --> 02:00:48,225
So, now you do what you have to and
I’ll do ...

902
02:00:48,225 --> 02:00:52,017
what I have been doing for
the last 25 years.

903
02:00:53,517 --> 02:01:02,100
The foundation of this structure
is so strong that no Raj Aryan,

904
02:01:02,392 --> 02:01:05,517
with a violin in his hand
and a smile on his face...

905
02:01:05,517 --> 02:01:10,017
will ever dare to walk in
here to change things around.

906
02:01:10,808 --> 02:01:14,975
Never, Mr. Raj Aryan, never.

907
02:01:27,267 --> 02:01:31,475
Megha, you were right.
It’s not easy to win from your father.

908
02:01:37,892 --> 02:01:42,183
He is one tough man .
but we are no less.

909
02:02:05,433 --> 02:02:11,642
Vicky, Vicky, give it back.
Samir I am warning you.

910
02:02:15,933 --> 02:02:18,642
Do any of you know
how to play the piano?

911
02:02:18,642 --> 02:02:22,808
it’s okay, it's okay.
I needed somebody to teach...

912
02:02:22,808 --> 02:02:27,017
Major Khanna's grandson, but never
mind maybe someone else would know.

913
02:02:34,017 --> 02:02:40,725
Vicky haven’t we heard
this name before, Major Khanna

914
02:02:48,808 --> 02:02:53,600
So, you would like to learn the
piano, Right. . Yes sir!

915
02:02:54,183 --> 02:02:58,600
Come down in ten minutes
we have a lot of work to do...

916
02:02:58,600 --> 02:03:03,475
and do come with some clothes on.

917
02:03:29,767 --> 02:03:35,433
Now Ayush, I want you to learn to play
the piano before your papa comes back.

918
02:03:36,642 --> 02:03:41,433
Do not worry sir, in one month he will
be playing even better than me.

919
02:03:42,767 --> 02:03:46,933
Ok Karan, I am leaving
you carry on! Right Ayush.

920
02:03:51,142 --> 02:03:55,642
Karan, just a minute, this is our
younger daughter in . law Kiran and...

921
02:03:55,642 --> 02:04:00,933
this is Karan Chaudhry,
Ayush's piano teacher.

922
02:04:05,517 --> 02:04:09,933
Karan, if you do not mind, can you
teach her too, along with Ayush.

923
02:04:10,517 --> 02:04:11,725
Sister . in . law!

924
02:04:11,725 --> 02:04:15,600
Hold on, she loves music in fact
she has learnt classical dance.

925
02:04:15,600 --> 02:04:16,517
Sister . in . law!

926
02:04:16,517 --> 02:04:19,100
Ok, ok, she does not do it anymore.

927
02:04:19,100 --> 02:04:23,725
Thank god she doesn’t, otherwise
she use to disturb me every morning.

928
02:04:24,100 --> 02:04:28,892
Ok ok, time out, time out!
Ayush get me a glass of water.

929
02:04:35,600 --> 02:04:36,683
Sister, get water.

930
02:04:36,683 --> 02:04:41,183
Ayush, this is wrong, your sister is
older than you, you go and get me water.

931
02:04:41,683 --> 02:04:45,767
Ok! In this house
I have to do all the work.

932
02:04:45,767 --> 02:04:48,767
Ramu kaka water!

933
02:04:48,767 --> 02:04:52,767
You never told me that
you used to dance?

934
02:04:58,767 --> 02:04:59,475
Why?

935
02:05:00,183 --> 02:05:04,350
You ask too many questions.
-That’s because you never answer.

936
02:05:04,683 --> 02:05:08,475
Have you come here to teach Ayush
piano lessons or to chat with me?

937
02:05:08,475 --> 02:05:12,767
What do you think?

938
02:05:23,642 --> 02:05:29,433
Ishika my child, meet your new dance
partner Vikram, not Viren! . right.

939
02:05:29,933 --> 02:05:34,017
Vikram I want you know that this
dance competition...

940
02:05:34,017 --> 02:05:37,017
...is a matter of prestige for
our college and...

941
02:05:37,017 --> 02:05:43,517
that is why on my request Mr. Raj Aryan
has sent you to help us out.

942
02:05:45,933 --> 02:05:51,517
Ishika, I want you'll to become friends
and in one month, show me something...

943
02:05:51,933 --> 02:05:57,225
really spectacular and special.

944
02:06:02,100 --> 02:06:06,183
Wipe that stupid grin off your face
it makes you look even more stupid.

945
02:06:06,600 --> 02:06:11,683
I have been winning this dance
competition for the past three years...

946
02:06:12,017 --> 02:06:16,308
and I am not going to end up loosing
this year because of an idiot like you

947
02:06:16,683 --> 02:06:21,683
-so if you do not wish to make a
fool of yourself just leave quietly.

948
02:06:22,100 --> 02:06:23,600
No please, don't do that.

949
02:06:23,600 --> 02:06:26,100
I have been waiting for
this all my life,

950
02:06:26,100 --> 02:06:29,892
all I have ever wanted is
to be able to dance with you.

951
02:06:29,892 --> 02:06:38,850
After this even if I die I will have
no regrets. Please dance with me.

952
02:06:39,475 --> 02:06:45,475
Your sense of humor is just
like you sick and disgusting!

953
02:06:45,975 --> 02:06:49,058
My name is Ishika!

954
02:06:49,058 --> 02:06:50,142
My friends feel that I was rude ...

955
02:06:50,142 --> 02:06:54,933
to you the other day when
you had come to apologize.

956
02:06:54,933 --> 02:06:57,850
And what do you feel?

957
02:06:57,850 --> 02:07:02,142
I think they are right.
I am sorry.

958
02:07:06,350 --> 02:07:08,642
Now, can you leave me?

959
02:07:08,642 --> 02:07:13,017
I do not feel like.
-Do you feel like a slap you.

960
02:07:15,350 --> 02:07:20,225
lf the girl smiles then she's yours.
-What?

961
02:07:20,225 --> 02:07:20,642
Nothing.

962
02:07:22,642 --> 02:07:28,017
Ok, leave me.
-Leave you?

963
02:08:08,392 --> 02:08:13,892
You didn’t join us.
-I am just.

964
02:08:27,975 --> 02:08:31,267
I would like to remind you that
till you are a part of Gurukul....

965
02:08:31,267 --> 02:08:34,767
it is your duty to follow the
traditions of this place.

966
02:08:34,767 --> 02:08:39,350
Next time I do not want
to see you outside the temple

967
02:08:39,350 --> 02:08:43,433
I’m sorry sir but
I will not come into the temple.

968
02:08:45,225 --> 02:08:47,225
I have an old score to
settle with him...

969
02:08:47,225 --> 02:08:51,642
he took the one person
who believed in him the most.

970
02:08:53,517 --> 02:08:55,642
Challenging us mortals
was not enough for you,

971
02:08:55,642 --> 02:08:57,225
that you have
decided to take on God.

972
02:08:57,225 --> 02:09:02,142
No sir, My God is my conscience.

973
02:09:03,725 --> 02:09:08,933
I do not believe in any other God.

974
02:09:14,308 --> 02:09:18,392
Take this .
for all your battles.

975
02:09:19,225 --> 02:09:23,100
I’m sorry sir, but I cannot.

976
02:09:23,100 --> 02:09:28,017
Because to take this I would have to
touch your feet, like the others...

977
02:09:28,600 --> 02:09:31,600
and that is something that
my heart will not allow me to do.

978
02:09:31,600 --> 02:09:38,975
I do not force anyone to touch my feet
Mr. Aryan .they do it out of respect.

979
02:09:39,475 --> 02:09:44,100
They touch your feet out of fear and
you mistake their fear for respect

980
02:09:44,475 --> 02:09:45,683
-but I’m...

981
02:09:45,683 --> 02:09:50,558
But you are not scared of me Mr. Aryan.
I know that...

982
02:09:51,975 --> 02:09:54,892
the other day you had put at tika
on my forehead ..

983
02:09:54,892 --> 02:09:59,683
...that day I had nothing
to give you.

984
02:09:59,850 --> 02:10:04,267
Today, accept this as a blessing...

985
02:10:04,475 --> 02:10:07,267
and it would remove a burden
from my head...

986
02:10:07,267 --> 02:10:12,350
and make us quits and yes
you do not have to touch my feet.

987
02:10:17,433 --> 02:10:24,225
lf this is about removing your burden
then I accept.

988
02:10:29,642 --> 02:10:34,850
You too sir.

989
02:11:07,517 --> 02:11:09,808
Samir! What are you doing here?

990
02:11:09,808 --> 02:11:11,517
Working, what else?

991
02:11:11,517 --> 02:11:15,683
For 500 rupees on a Sunday and
the chance to see a Singhania party...

992
02:11:15,683 --> 02:11:19,308
...only a fool can
refuse such an offer.

993
02:11:19,308 --> 02:11:20,600
I don't believe you,
anyway it’s great that ...

994
02:11:20,600 --> 02:11:22,267
...i found you,
now just stay with me.

995
02:11:22,267 --> 02:11:24,683
Sanjana, leave my hand
it does not look good

996
02:11:24,683 --> 02:11:25,892
I am supposed to be working here
and besides this is...

997
02:11:25,892 --> 02:11:29,767
your boyfriends party so I am sure
you know everyone here.

998
02:11:29,767 --> 02:11:32,975
No, I do not .these are all Deepak's
friends. I do not know them that well.

999
02:11:32,975 --> 02:11:37,767
I’m sorry Sanjana . but I do not want
to get fired because of you . Ok.

1000
02:11:39,350 --> 02:11:42,767
Come let me introduce you to everyone.
Where have you been, come on, come on.

1001
02:11:42,767 --> 02:11:47,558
What rubbish.

1002
02:12:14,850 --> 02:12:22,933
I was just kidding .
Come on give me your hand, c'mon

1003
02:13:00,183 --> 02:13:04,183
Listen Sanjana I’m sorry, ok.
I should not have done that . please.

1004
02:13:04,183 --> 02:13:07,975
Enough Deepak, enough.

1005
02:13:30,642 --> 02:13:32,475
All guys are alike.

1006
02:13:32,475 --> 02:13:35,058
You said something?

1007
02:13:35,058 --> 02:13:37,558
You know, you boys are so stupid.

1008
02:13:37,558 --> 02:13:41,767
It’s so easy for any girl
to draw your attention.

1009
02:13:41,767 --> 02:13:45,350
All she needs to do is dress
suggestively like our dear friend...

1010
02:13:45,350 --> 02:13:49,225
Sonia and she's got you'll all
wrapped around her little finger.

1011
02:13:49,225 --> 02:13:52,142
That’s all you boys ever
think of, right.

1012
02:13:52,142 --> 02:13:55,725
You'll never think of what kind of
person she is what is in her heart...

1013
02:13:55,725 --> 02:13:58,517
...how she talks, do you'll?

1014
02:13:58,517 --> 02:14:03,308
You're right,
we never think of such things, never!

1015
02:14:07,308 --> 02:14:12,017
Do you know what your problem is
you are jealous of Sonia.

1016
02:14:12,933 --> 02:14:15,433
I am jealous of Sonia?

1017
02:14:15,433 --> 02:14:19,308
Yes. Because basically you
want to be just like Sonia,

1018
02:14:19,308 --> 02:14:21,517
but you know that is impossible
let’s face it,...

1019
02:14:21,517 --> 02:14:26,017
...you do not have what it takes and
that makes you hate her even more.

1020
02:14:26,517 --> 02:14:31,892
I think you have a big complex and
you should deal with it.

1021
02:14:34,100 --> 02:14:38,183
Listen Mr. Vikram Oberoi, Neither am l
jealous nor do I hate anyone.

1022
02:14:38,683 --> 02:14:43,100
I am very happy the way
I am . as for your Sonia

1023
02:14:43,100 --> 02:14:45,683
I can be like her anytime,
if I want to.

1024
02:14:45,683 --> 02:14:50,058
But she can never be like me,
ever . understand.

1025
02:14:50,058 --> 02:14:55,183
Believe me Ishika
You can never look like Sonia

1026
02:14:59,475 --> 02:15:03,475
Vicky, I am not getting this dance
step do help me please.

1027
02:15:19,933 --> 02:15:23,142
Why are you not ready yet
we have to go to Mr. Sharma's house.

1028
02:15:23,142 --> 02:15:25,933
I do not feel like going.

1029
02:15:25,933 --> 02:15:32,017
Every time the same excuse,
sometimes it’s good to go out...

1030
02:15:32,517 --> 02:15:35,350
meet people, make friends.

1031
02:15:35,350 --> 02:15:39,433
You cannot shut yourself from
the world, forever . can you?

1032
02:15:41,225 --> 02:15:45,433
Ok, take your time...

1033
02:15:47,225 --> 02:15:50,600
we will be late make sure
that Ayush sleeps on time...

1034
02:15:50,600 --> 02:15:55,308
and no MTV or ZTV for him.

1035
02:16:13,183 --> 02:16:18,683
A small gift, for a girl,
who is incomplete without this.

1036
02:16:21,267 --> 02:16:25,600
What happened?
You did not like the gift.

1037
02:16:25,600 --> 02:16:28,267
You, what are you doing here?
Have you gone mad?

1038
02:16:28,267 --> 02:16:30,392
lf somebody sees you,
do you know what will happen.

1039
02:16:30,392 --> 02:16:32,058
Relax, no one has seen me.

1040
02:16:32,058 --> 02:16:33,267
I don't know anything,
just go from here.

1041
02:16:33,267 --> 02:16:36,975
Ok, Ok, I will go on one condition.

1042
02:16:36,975 --> 02:16:37,683
What?

1043
02:16:38,183 --> 02:16:41,475
I want to see you dance
wearing these ghungroos, just once.

1044
02:16:41,475 --> 02:16:42,350
I cannot do it.

1045
02:16:42,350 --> 02:16:46,767
Hey, you can't say no,
it’s the first rule of friendship...

1046
02:16:47,267 --> 02:16:50,142
you can never say no
to anything that a friend asks for.

1047
02:16:50,142 --> 02:16:51,850
Karan stop it .
I am getting very scared.

1048
02:16:51,850 --> 02:16:55,933
Nandini, Nandini . hurry up,
we are getting late.

1049
02:16:55,933 --> 02:16:57,642
Yes father, I am downstairs.

1050
02:16:57,642 --> 02:17:00,267
Karan, you please go from here.

1051
02:17:00,267 --> 02:17:01,558
First promise me.

1052
02:17:01,558 --> 02:17:06,558
I do not know how to dance . I used to
do it before, but now I have forgotten.

1053
02:17:07,225 --> 02:17:13,642
Listen, I wanted to make my friend
happy so I got her a gift.

1054
02:17:14,017 --> 02:17:18,017
Now if you feel like making your
friend happy then come to ...

1055
02:17:18,017 --> 02:17:23,142
...the terrace wearing those
ghungroos it's as simple as that.

1056
02:17:29,517 --> 02:17:33,308
Why are you doing all this, Karan?

1057
02:17:33,308 --> 02:17:37,308
Because there is this friend of
mine who is scared to be happy...

1058
02:17:38,017 --> 02:17:43,225
...I want to show her how easy
it is, to be happy.

1059
02:17:58,100 --> 02:18:03,683
Why did this happen Samir
how could I make such a big mistake.

1060
02:18:05,975 --> 02:18:11,267
Do you really want to know?

1061
02:18:27,267 --> 02:18:32,142
This was your mistake this is not
Sanjana, this is someone else.

1062
02:19:01,308 --> 02:19:06,433
This is my Sanju clumsy, messy, cute.

1063
02:19:07,808 --> 02:19:11,933
You had forgotten yourself,
when you were with Deepak...

1064
02:19:13,308 --> 02:19:18,600
you had become the way he wanted
to see you .this was your mistake.

1065
02:19:28,308 --> 02:19:37,392
He should love you for what you are
and not for what he wants you to be...

1066
02:19:38,683 --> 02:19:44,892
lf someone tries to change you,
then it is not love, but a compromise

1067
02:19:47,183 --> 02:19:55,767
And darling, one doesn’t compromise
in love. You forgot your own rule.

1068
02:20:01,683 --> 02:20:02,183
Let’s go.

1069
02:20:08,767 --> 02:20:13,767
Samir, can you hold me in your arms
please.

1070
02:28:37,350 --> 02:28:42,725
You won.
Their love stories have begun, you won.

1071
02:28:46,225 --> 02:28:47,725
We won!

1072
02:29:18,392 --> 02:29:23,100
''Come, steal me from my self''

1073
02:29:23,517 --> 02:29:27,600
''Hide me somewhere in your heart''

1074
02:29:40,100 --> 02:29:44,267
''Don't let me get lost in loneliness''

1075
02:29:45,683 --> 02:29:50,767
''Don't let me lose you''

1076
02:29:50,767 --> 02:29:55,683
''Come to me. Take me in your arms''

1077
02:29:57,475 --> 02:30:02,183
''Come, steal me from my self''

1078
02:30:02,767 --> 02:30:08,142
''Hide me somewhere in your heart''

1079
02:30:08,350 --> 02:30:12,767
''Don't let me get lost in loneliness''

1080
02:30:13,767 --> 02:30:19,142
''Don't let me lose you''

1081
02:30:19,350 --> 02:30:23,725
''Come to me. Take me in your arms''

1082
02:30:26,058 --> 02:30:30,517
''Come, steal me from my self''

1083
02:30:30,933 --> 02:30:36,225
''Hide me somewhere in your heart''

1084
02:31:21,892 --> 02:31:26,392
''Make my heart beat faster''

1085
02:31:27,392 --> 02:31:31,892
''Let your hair spread out''

1086
02:31:32,767 --> 02:31:37,350
''Give me a shy smile''

1087
02:31:38,267 --> 02:31:43,350
''Let the wind catch your veil''

1088
02:31:43,350 --> 02:31:47,975
''l could let my hair spread,
but it could turn day into night''

1089
02:31:48,975 --> 02:31:53,933
''l could let my veil wave with the wind
but there could be a cloudburst of desire''

1090
02:31:54,642 --> 02:31:59,642
''Let it pour''

1091
02:32:00,267 --> 02:32:05,433
''We have something
to talk about''

1092
02:32:05,933 --> 02:32:11,225
''Come to me. Take me in your arms''

1093
02:32:12,017 --> 02:32:16,850
''Come, steal me from my self''

1094
02:32:17,517 --> 02:32:22,433
''Hide me somewhere in your heart''

1095
02:32:22,433 --> 02:32:26,808
''Don't let me get lost in loneliness''

1096
02:32:28,017 --> 02:32:32,433
''Don't let me lose you''

1097
02:32:33,600 --> 02:32:37,892
''Come to me. Take me in your arms''

1098
02:33:53,350 --> 02:33:57,350
''l could die for you''

1099
02:33:58,642 --> 02:34:03,433
''I’m going to die''

1100
02:34:04,225 --> 02:34:08,225
''They all say that''

1101
02:34:09,433 --> 02:34:14,225
''I’ll do it''

1102
02:34:14,517 --> 02:34:17,100
''A little vermilion...''

1103
02:34:17,100 --> 02:34:20,017
''fill in my hair''

1104
02:34:20,017 --> 02:34:22,892
''Who has seen tomorrow?''

1105
02:34:22,892 --> 02:34:26,100
''Do it all, today, now''

1106
02:34:26,100 --> 02:34:31,017
''Whether or not, everyone agrees''

1107
02:34:31,017 --> 02:34:34,100
''When hearts avow''

1108
02:34:34,100 --> 02:34:37,100
''God acquiesces''

1109
02:34:37,100 --> 02:34:41,267
''Come to me .Take me in your arms''

1110
02:34:43,392 --> 02:34:48,267
''Come, steal me from my self''

1111
02:34:48,558 --> 02:34:53,892
''Hide me somewhere in your heart''

1112
02:34:54,558 --> 02:34:59,350
''Come, steal me from my self''

1113
02:35:00,183 --> 02:35:05,350
''Hide me somewhere in your heart''

1114
02:35:05,475 --> 02:35:09,558
''Don't let me get lost in loneliness''

1115
02:35:10,475 --> 02:35:14,767
''Don't let me lose you''

1116
02:35:16,433 --> 02:35:20,767
''Come to me. Take me in your arms''

1117
02:37:01,142 --> 02:37:03,558
What is your name?

1118
02:37:03,558 --> 02:37:07,058
Sir, Vi ..Vi...Vic...Vikram , Sir.

1119
02:37:07,058 --> 02:37:10,225
Are you aware of the
rules of Gurukul?

1120
02:37:10,225 --> 02:37:10,642
Yes sir!

1121
02:37:12,225 --> 02:37:16,225
So you know that you have broken
one of the rules...

1122
02:37:16,933 --> 02:37:20,142
...and that you can be
expelled for it.

1123
02:37:20,142 --> 02:37:20,725
Yes sir!

1124
02:37:22,142 --> 02:37:26,600
So tell me Vikram what is
the reason for your carelessness?

1125
02:37:27,225 --> 02:37:31,600
Sir, I was, I was....

1126
02:37:34,308 --> 02:37:45,517
Vicky...
Did you reach the station on time.

1127
02:37:47,017 --> 02:37:48,183
Station sir?

1128
02:37:48,183 --> 02:37:52,475
The parcel that I gave you did
the station master accept it?

1129
02:37:52,475 --> 02:37:57,392
Parcel, yes sir. The station
master accepted your parcel sir.

1130
02:37:58,100 --> 02:38:02,975
Great . it’s very late, you go to
bed and Vicky thank you very much.

1131
02:38:22,267 --> 02:38:25,767
It’s very late sir . you
should also go to sleep,

1132
02:38:25,767 --> 02:38:27,142
otherwise for the first time...

1133
02:38:27,142 --> 02:38:33,850
the sun will rise before you do.
Good night.

1134
02:39:21,225 --> 02:39:24,808
I have called all of you here because

1135
02:39:24,808 --> 02:39:26,683
I have found out that
a few students are...

1136
02:39:26,683 --> 02:39:29,600
trying to break the discipline of
Gurukul a few students have been...

1137
02:39:29,600 --> 02:39:35,392
...leaving the campus regularly
and not returning on time.

1138
02:39:38,600 --> 02:39:42,600
I would like to remind them that
breaking the rules of Gurukul...

1139
02:39:42,600 --> 02:39:47,558
... will not be tolerated.

1140
02:39:50,183 --> 02:39:55,392
I think my silence has been
misunderstood to be my weakness.

1141
02:39:58,767 --> 02:40:02,475
So from today, the Gurukul gate
will be shut at all times.

1142
02:40:02,975 --> 02:40:07,475
From now on no one will leave the gates
of this campus, under any circumstance.

1143
02:40:07,558 --> 02:40:10,642
Anyone caught will be expelled
immediately I repeat...

1144
02:40:10,642 --> 02:40:24,933
...anyone caught will be expelled
immediately. You'll can go now.

1145
02:40:50,433 --> 02:40:55,808
Mr. Aryan I know everything
that goes on in Gurukul...

1146
02:40:56,392 --> 02:41:01,017
...nothing escapes my eyes.

1147
02:41:03,183 --> 02:41:08,683
Those three boys will
have to stop going out.

1148
02:41:12,100 --> 02:41:16,808
There will be no part time working
no piano playing, and no dancing.

1149
02:41:21,767 --> 02:41:26,183
I would like you to be the one
to break this news to them.

1150
02:41:30,683 --> 02:41:31,475
Yes sir.

1151
02:41:58,267 --> 02:42:02,433
It’s nice to see you smiling
Mr. Shankar.

1152
02:42:03,725 --> 02:42:06,558
It must be a very special morning.

1153
02:42:06,558 --> 02:42:08,933
Definitely Mr. Aryan.

1154
02:42:08,933 --> 02:42:11,142
Do you see these blowing
winds these winds...

1155
02:42:11,142 --> 02:42:15,350
have been blowing from
the east for years.

1156
02:42:17,017 --> 02:42:23,808
Some time back they had changed their
direction to the west, but now...

1157
02:42:24,308 --> 02:42:29,308
they are back to normal.

1158
02:42:31,808 --> 02:42:36,517
Today, everything is back to
normal Mr. Aryan.

1159
02:42:37,600 --> 02:42:39,725
It is a very special morning.

1160
02:42:39,725 --> 02:42:44,183
Congratulations Mr. Shankar,
even the winds are scared of you...

1161
02:42:44,183 --> 02:42:47,683
even they know that you
do not like changes.

1162
02:42:47,683 --> 02:42:52,392
It just shows the power of
your fear.

1163
02:42:53,683 --> 02:42:58,600
You were the one who made me aware
of the power of my fear Mr. Aryan.

1164
02:43:00,100 --> 02:43:04,767
You were the one who told me
that everyone is scared of me .

1165
02:43:04,767 --> 02:43:07,892
that they love you,
and fear me . right.

1166
02:43:07,892 --> 02:43:11,975
But I want you to know something
Mr. Aryan...

1167
02:43:11,975 --> 02:43:17,350
...that in the battle of love and fear,
fear will always win.

1168
02:43:17,975 --> 02:43:22,183
Till now you have only
seen the power of fear.

1169
02:43:23,975 --> 02:43:28,475
You have still not seen
the power of love.

1170
02:43:38,767 --> 02:43:42,558
I would like to see such power,
Mr. Aryan.

1171
02:43:46,725 --> 02:43:51,350
I would really like to see
that happen.

1172
02:43:52,225 --> 02:43:57,642
Now you'll definitely see the power
of love you definitely will.

1173
02:44:19,725 --> 02:44:23,808
Today is 14th February
Valentine’s Day ,the day of love.

1174
02:44:24,517 --> 02:44:28,892
Today I am going to begin
by telling you a love story.

1175
02:44:28,892 --> 02:44:34,183
A story of a boy, a girl and a leaf
a story of one of you'll, a boy ...

1176
02:44:34,683 --> 02:44:40,600
from Gurukul, but there was one
difference he was in love,

1177
02:44:40,975 --> 02:44:43,767
and he had decided that on this day,

1178
02:44:43,767 --> 02:44:50,392
he would tell her everything,
not worrying about the consequences.

1179
02:44:53,975 --> 02:44:56,767
She was standing at the bus stop
with her friends...

1180
02:44:56,767 --> 02:44:59,350
waiting to leave for
the college picnic.

1181
02:44:59,350 --> 02:45:02,975
The boy had sneaked out of Gurukul
and had come running to see her.

1182
02:45:02,975 --> 02:45:05,767
He saw her getting into the bus,

1183
02:45:05,767 --> 02:45:08,350
he immediately took out
a pen from his pocket...

1184
02:45:08,350 --> 02:45:10,642
and tried to find something
to write on.

1185
02:45:10,642 --> 02:45:14,350
Then he picked up a leaf from the
ground and wrote on it.

1186
02:45:14,350 --> 02:45:18,850
Dear Megha, I love you.
He gave it to a kid on the street...

1187
02:45:19,558 --> 02:45:21,350
and pointed towards the girl.

1188
02:45:21,350 --> 02:45:23,058
The kid ran with the leaf
towards the girl...

1189
02:45:23,058 --> 02:45:25,433
who was just about to enter the bus.

1190
02:45:25,433 --> 02:45:29,517
Just then there was a convoy of army
trucks which blocked his view,

1191
02:45:29,517 --> 02:45:31,642
and he could not see the girl.

1192
02:45:31,642 --> 02:45:36,350
When the last truck crossed him...

1193
02:45:36,725 --> 02:45:40,642
he saw that all the girls had
already got into the bus.

1194
02:45:41,725 --> 02:45:44,433
As he turned, he saw the same kid
standing in front of him...

1195
02:45:44,433 --> 02:45:46,017
holding the leaf.

1196
02:45:46,017 --> 02:45:48,517
There was something written on
the other side of the leaf...

1197
02:45:48,517 --> 02:45:52,517
I have waited so long to
hearths . Megha.

1198
02:45:52,517 --> 02:45:54,517
But, by that time the bus had
already left.

1199
02:45:54,517 --> 02:45:59,725
He ran behind the bus and
stopped in the middle of the road.

1200
02:46:03,683 --> 02:46:08,017
He turned, he saw her standing
in front of him.

1201
02:46:50,975 --> 02:46:58,767
So this was a true love story
that happened on Valentine’s Day.

1202
02:47:00,642 --> 02:47:02,558
Sir, what happened next?

1203
02:47:02,558 --> 02:47:07,433
Then, they got married and they
lived happily ever after, right sir?

1204
02:47:09,850 --> 02:47:14,225
Wrong! What happened next,
you all know.

1205
02:47:16,142 --> 02:47:19,225
Because this is the story of the one...

1206
02:47:19,225 --> 02:47:21,642
and only student who was
thrown out of Gurukul.

1207
02:47:21,642 --> 02:47:26,225
The one who some of
you'll call the crazy lover.

1208
02:47:26,725 --> 02:47:33,600
Was he crazy or was he just mad,
or was he a boy just like you'll...

1209
02:47:37,517 --> 02:47:39,517
I do not know.

1210
02:47:39,517 --> 02:47:44,183
But I know one thing that he
listened to his heart all his life.

1211
02:47:44,392 --> 02:47:48,517
I know that he gave up everything
for the woman he loved...

1212
02:47:49,183 --> 02:47:57,183
and I know that he stills loves her...

1213
02:47:58,767 --> 02:48:11,183
and each day the love
deepens more and more.

1214
02:48:13,392 --> 02:48:18,058
How do you know so much about him?

1215
02:48:22,767 --> 02:48:30,350
How do I know so much about him
how do I know so much!

1216
02:49:49,058 --> 02:49:53,683
My name is not Vikram Oberoi,
but Vikram kapoor.

1217
02:49:53,683 --> 02:49:58,350
My father is not a rich industrialist
but is a bank accountant.

1218
02:49:59,767 --> 02:50:03,350
And the friendship that I had
started with a lie...

1219
02:50:03,350 --> 02:50:05,850
I want to end it with the truth...

1220
02:50:05,850 --> 02:50:12,850
and the truth is that
I am madly in love with you.

1221
02:50:19,350 --> 02:50:24,558
I know it is not easy to
love a stubborn,

1222
02:50:24,558 --> 02:50:30,933
and spoilt girl like you,
but I know that...

1223
02:50:31,517 --> 02:50:35,933
behind this stubborn girl,
is a cute little girl...

1224
02:50:37,433 --> 02:50:43,933
who reads love stories at night and
dreams about love, even in the day.

1225
02:50:46,225 --> 02:50:51,517
Behind this spoilt girl, there
is a girl with a clear conscience...

1226
02:50:51,517 --> 02:50:55,600
who sweetly accepts her mistakes
and says ''sorry.''

1227
02:50:58,808 --> 02:51:02,808
Behind this Ishika Dhanrajgir
is my cute,

1228
02:51:02,808 --> 02:51:07,683
stupid little Ishq whom I love
and cannot live without.

1229
02:51:55,350 --> 02:51:59,058
You talk a lot.

1230
02:51:59,058 --> 02:52:03,225
lf you quieting me like this,
I will never shut up.

1231
02:52:12,225 --> 02:52:17,142
I want you to leave Karan . forever.

1232
02:52:17,142 --> 02:52:21,433
But why, what have I done?

1233
02:52:21,433 --> 02:52:27,725
You've not done anything Karan in fact,
you have only given me happiness.

1234
02:52:28,308 --> 02:52:32,100
You brought back music and gave
me your friendship...

1235
02:52:32,100 --> 02:52:35,517
for which I will always be grateful .

1236
02:52:35,517 --> 02:52:40,808
but you also brought back those
dreams, desires, and hopes...

1237
02:52:41,308 --> 02:52:44,392
that I had shut out, and kept in
a little corner of my heart .

1238
02:52:44,392 --> 02:52:48,392
those dreams that belonged to a
seventeen year old Kiran...

1239
02:52:49,183 --> 02:52:54,100
those dreams that have no place
in this Kiran's life.

1240
02:52:56,600 --> 02:53:03,100
I cannot be your friend anymore
please forgive me and forget me.

1241
02:53:09,183 --> 02:53:13,267
There is a rule of friendship Kiran
that once you put your hand forward...

1242
02:53:14,058 --> 02:53:16,058
it can never be taken back.

1243
02:53:16,058 --> 02:53:18,058
Please Karan, go from here.

1244
02:53:18,058 --> 02:53:21,058
Today I had come here to tell you
something Kiran...

1245
02:53:21,058 --> 02:53:25,558
and I am not going back
till I say it.

1246
02:53:42,433 --> 02:53:47,058
What did you want to tell her
even I would like to hear it.

1247
02:54:01,433 --> 02:54:06,017
Sir, I came here to tell her that
I love her...

1248
02:54:08,517 --> 02:54:14,225
...that I love her very much
and I know that even she

1249
02:54:28,892 --> 02:54:37,308
I think you have got your answer
now leave and never come back.

1250
02:54:51,183 --> 02:54:55,475
Wait, Karan!

1251
02:55:04,558 --> 02:55:06,475
Do you love this boy?

1252
02:55:06,475 --> 02:55:10,767
Tell me the truth,
do you love him.

1253
02:55:11,267 --> 02:55:13,267
Nandini, do you realize
what you are saying?

1254
02:55:13,267 --> 02:55:16,267
For once in your life Kiran,
listen to your heart and...

1255
02:55:16,267 --> 02:55:17,933
tell me if you love Karan.

1256
02:55:17,933 --> 02:55:20,558
Nandini, you are talking
to a married girl.

1257
02:55:20,558 --> 02:55:21,850
No, Major General Khanna

1258
02:55:21,850 --> 02:55:24,850
I am talking to a girl whose
husband is dead

1259
02:55:24,850 --> 02:55:27,850
I am talking to a widow
Major General Khanna

1260
02:55:27,850 --> 02:55:32,350
I am talking to a widow

1261
02:55:33,642 --> 02:55:35,433
Look at this girl closely,

1262
02:55:35,433 --> 02:55:42,142
and for once do not look at her
as the youngest daughter-in-law ...

1263
02:55:42,642 --> 02:55:45,517
of your family, but instead,
look at her as the young girl,

1264
02:55:45,517 --> 02:55:47,308
whom you had brought into this...

1265
02:55:47,308 --> 02:55:51,100
house with promises
and dreams of a happy life.

1266
02:55:51,433 --> 02:55:55,808
Look at her as the girl, who has,
for two years...

1267
02:55:56,517 --> 02:55:58,600
quietly played the role of
a married girl just for you.

1268
02:55:58,600 --> 02:56:03,808
So that by seeing her, you can keep
believing that your son is alive.

1269
02:56:07,017 --> 02:56:11,892
Look at her, and ask yourself,

1270
02:56:16,100 --> 02:56:20,392
what is wrong if someone falls
in love with her...

1271
02:56:20,975 --> 02:56:28,558
what is wrong if she falls in love
with someone, what is so wrong?

1272
02:56:32,475 --> 02:56:38,558
Your son is dead,
at least let her live.

1273
02:56:44,350 --> 02:56:49,642
My son is not dead.
My son is not dead.

1274
02:57:37,225 --> 02:57:43,517
Ever since we used to laugh and cry
about small things, I have loved you.

1275
02:57:44,017 --> 02:57:49,892
Ever since we used to dance
in the rains I have loved you.

1276
02:57:50,392 --> 02:57:55,683
When we used to sneak out to the
terrace and count the stars...

1277
02:57:56,183 --> 02:57:58,767
I have loved you.

1278
02:57:58,767 --> 02:58:04,100
Now, I myself, have forgotten
since when, I have loved you.

1279
02:58:04,892 --> 02:58:10,558
I can only say, that I have loved you
and only you.

1280
02:58:38,058 --> 02:58:41,850
You love me so much?

1281
02:58:44,850 --> 02:58:48,350
Since when?

1282
02:58:48,350 --> 02:58:49,433
Always.

1283
02:58:51,225 --> 02:58:55,350
And till today,
you never said a thing.

1284
02:58:57,308 --> 02:59:03,017
Idiot . Stupid . Now what are you
standing and staring at my face.

1285
02:59:04,642 --> 02:59:08,433
Come on, take me in your arms.

1286
02:59:26,017 --> 02:59:32,392
Kakeji, you used to give me roses etc.
today am I not getting a leaf?

1287
02:59:34,683 --> 02:59:40,600
No Preetoji, from now on Kake
will never trouble you.

1288
02:59:41,183 --> 02:59:47,558
Seeing these kids, I have figured
out what a perfect pair looks like.

1289
02:59:49,558 --> 02:59:57,350
You are very pretty, and smart and I’m
a stupid looking and uneducated.

1290
02:59:57,850 --> 03:00:01,183
This pair is all wrong.

1291
03:00:01,183 --> 03:00:04,267
You need not worry, from today, you'll
never have to take your shoes in...

1292
03:00:04,267 --> 03:00:10,850
your hand, from today Kake will
never trouble you.

1293
03:00:12,767 --> 03:00:15,267
This is my final goodbye to you.

1294
03:00:15,267 --> 03:00:19,850
And what if after today Preeto
starts troubling Kake.

1295
03:00:21,142 --> 03:00:21,725
What?

1296
03:00:23,350 --> 03:00:28,225
Then what. Eat sugar and die.
What do you think of yourself?

1297
03:00:29,142 --> 03:00:31,933
you have been giving me weird stuff,
and saying rubbish...

1298
03:00:31,933 --> 03:00:36,308
and now you are saying, that from
today you will never trouble me.

1299
03:00:36,308 --> 03:00:40,017
Why will you not trouble me
you'll have to trouble me.

1300
03:00:40,017 --> 03:00:43,725
Because Preeto,
has gotten used to Kake nonsense.

1301
03:00:43,725 --> 03:00:48,517
And besides, Preeto likes Kake.

1302
03:00:49,100 --> 03:00:50,225
Likes ma'am?

1303
03:00:50,225 --> 03:00:57,808
Yes. And who said you are stupid
looking. You are very cute.

1304
03:00:59,225 --> 03:01:04,183
Yes, and what do they say in English
I love you.

1305
03:01:04,392 --> 03:01:05,683
What?

1306
03:01:27,267 --> 03:01:32,183
I can hear the bricks crumbling
Mr. Shankar, can you hear it?

1307
03:01:34,850 --> 03:01:40,183
The winds have changed their
direction once again...

1308
03:01:40,183 --> 03:01:45,350
the power of love Mr. Shankar...

1309
03:01:47,850 --> 03:01:53,058
you better lock your windows and doors
properly sir because love is in the...

1310
03:01:59,142 --> 03:02:03,558
air and no one can stop it now.

1311
03:02:56,100 --> 03:03:01,600
''On chained feet...''

1312
03:03:03,267 --> 03:03:06,975
''chiming anklets scream...''

1313
03:03:11,267 --> 03:03:15,558
''shut all doors...''

1314
03:03:16,350 --> 03:03:20,058
''but the thief will steal in''

1315
03:03:24,558 --> 03:03:30,058
''Break your shackles''

1316
03:03:32,433 --> 03:03:37,767
''Let your anklets chime''

1317
03:03:40,058 --> 03:03:43,850
''Open the doors of your heart''

1318
03:03:44,933 --> 03:03:49,142
''Let the thief in''

1319
03:04:23,808 --> 03:04:28,100
''Oh what do I say, what do I do?
I feel so shy''

1320
03:04:28,808 --> 03:04:33,100
''Don't make me pine.
This is killing me''

1321
03:04:33,975 --> 03:04:38,600
''First let me get to believe
that you truly love me''

1322
03:04:39,267 --> 03:04:44,100
''lf there's any doubt in
your heart, let's forget it''

1323
03:04:45,475 --> 03:04:49,683
''l won't give myself up so easily''

1324
03:04:50,475 --> 03:04:52,558
''I’ll think it over first''

1325
03:04:52,558 --> 03:04:55,683
''Then I’ll tell you tomorrow
or the day after''

1326
03:04:55,683 --> 03:05:03,142
''lf you won't say yes today,
someone else can marry you''

1327
03:06:57,933 --> 03:07:02,142
''Those who are made for each other,
shall meet, come what may''

1328
03:07:02,725 --> 03:07:07,058
''Hearts blossom, even in autumn''

1329
03:07:08,350 --> 03:07:12,725
''My friends, the whole world says
the heart is crazy''

1330
03:07:12,725 --> 03:07:17,017
''Loving hearts say that
the world is crazy''

1331
03:07:19,142 --> 03:07:23,517
''l have come, my love,
I have left the world behind''

1332

''l have broken all ties,
I come to bind myself to you''

1333
03:07:29,433 --> 03:07:31,933
''Let's bind ourselves
to each other''

1334
03:07:31,933 --> 03:07:36,725
''In bondage let us fly together,
like kite and string''

1335
03:07:37,600 --> 03:07:43,100
''On chained feet...''

''but the thief will steal in''

1345
03:08:21,350 --> 03:08:23,767
''The thief will steal in''

1346
03:08:23,767 --> 03:08:27,558
''The thief will steal in''

1347
03:09:47,975 --> 03:09:53,058
''For all the hatred in the world...''

1348
03:09:53,183 --> 03:09:58,058
''hearts are still full of love''

1349
03:10:08,350 --> 03:10:12,850
''Even after lovers have died...''

1350
03:10:13,350 --> 03:10:17,767
''after their beloveds have perished...''

1351
03:10:19,142 --> 03:10:23,142
''their loves live on, forever''

1352
03:11:16,183 --> 03:11:21,100
''Even after lovers have died...''

1353
03:11:21,100 --> 03:11:25,183
''after their beloveds
have perished...''

1354
03:11:26,475 --> 03:11:31,475
''their loves live on, forever''

1355
03:11:31,475 --> 03:11:36,683
''Their loves live on, forever''

1356
03:12:16,725 --> 03:12:18,308
I know that this is not the first
time that the three of...

1357
03:12:18,308 --> 03:12:23,433
you'll have broken
the rules of Gurukul.

1358
03:12:23,642 --> 03:12:25,600
I also know that you'll are
responsible for...

1359
03:12:25,600 --> 03:12:30,517
the others behaving in a
similar fashion.

1360
03:12:40,100 --> 03:12:47,683
You'll have left me with no choice,
but before I take a decision,

1361
03:12:49,600 --> 03:12:52,308
I would like to ask you'll
one question,

1362
03:12:52,308 --> 03:12:57,600
and I would like you'll to think
very carefully before answering it...

1363
03:12:59,267 --> 03:13:03,475
...because whatever you will say,
will decide your fate.

1364
03:13:16,267 --> 03:13:20,558
Did you do this out of your
own free will

1365
03:13:20,850 --> 03:13:25,267
or is someone else
responsible for this...

1366
03:13:25,267 --> 03:13:32,267
someone who encouraged and
forced you'll to do this,

1367
03:13:36,267 --> 03:13:41,433
think carefully and answer.

1368
03:13:45,558 --> 03:13:49,933
We take full responsibility
for our actions...

1369
03:13:49,933 --> 03:13:53,017
nobody else is responsible
for what we did.

1370
03:13:53,017 --> 03:13:57,517
We did what our hearts told
us to do.

1371
03:13:57,517 --> 03:14:00,225
And we do not regret
anything because...

1372
03:14:00,225 --> 03:14:04,933
we do not think we did
anything wrong.

1373
03:14:13,225 --> 03:14:17,725
This is your last day in Gurukul
start packing your bags.

1374
03:14:18,392 --> 03:14:22,308
You'll will be expelled in the
morning in front of everyone.

1375
03:16:19,567 --> 03:16:24,483
You won, I lost!

1376
03:16:25,483 --> 03:16:28,983
But do not punish them
for my mistakes...

1377
03:16:28,983 --> 03:16:31,692
do not do this to them, please.

1378
03:16:31,692 --> 03:16:36,275
I did not come here to make
another Raj Aryan.

1379
03:16:36,983 --> 03:16:41,275
I came here to make sure that
no one else becomes a Raj Aryan.

1380
03:16:43,150 --> 03:16:48,358
Forgive them, your battle is with
me and I am in front of you...

1381
03:16:51,442 --> 03:16:55,442
Defeated and lost.

1382
03:16:55,442 --> 03:17:00,150
I will do whatever you want
just forgive them.

1383
03:17:07,817 --> 03:17:12,650
You won, I lost.

1384
03:17:34,317 --> 03:17:35,900
I want you to come tomorrow
morning...

1385
03:17:36,025 --> 03:17:38,192
and tell the students,
that whatever you...

1386
03:17:38,192 --> 03:17:48,192
have taught them, and
believed in, was wrong.

1387
03:17:51,983 --> 03:17:56,483
I want you to tell them, that you
do not believe in love and...

1388
03:17:58,400 --> 03:18:09,567
...that you are sorry for
misleading them...

1389
03:18:12,567 --> 03:18:18,775
...and then quietly leave Gurukul...

1390
03:18:22,358 --> 03:18:28,775
...and never come back.

1391
03:18:33,442 --> 03:18:34,150
Yes.

1392
03:18:40,233 --> 03:18:44,150
Good, you can go now.

1393
03:18:55,525 --> 03:19:00,733
I had told you Mr. Aryan,
in the battle of love and fear...

1394
03:19:02,025 --> 03:19:06,900
fear will always win.

1395
03:19:24,817 --> 03:19:31,692
I am sorry sir, but from
where I see you lost.

1396
03:19:34,400 --> 03:19:39,567
Because from where I see, I see a
55 year old father standing below...

1397
03:19:40,775 --> 03:19:45,692
a garlanded photograph of his
19 year old daughter.

1398
03:19:48,358 --> 03:19:52,858
You lost then, and you lost now.

1399
03:20:01,067 --> 03:20:05,567
You ever wondered Mr.Shankarthat
why did I ever come back to Gurukul?

1400
03:20:06,275 --> 03:20:13,650
For whom? The girl I loved
is no more...

1401
03:20:15,233 --> 03:20:19,650
who are Vicky, Samir,
and Karan to me.

1402
03:20:19,650 --> 03:20:24,942
I did not even know them,
I did not know anyone here.

1403
03:20:28,525 --> 03:20:32,942
I came back for you, Mr. Shankar.

1404
03:20:35,608 --> 03:20:41,025
I came back for the father of
the girl, I loved.

1405
03:20:45,108 --> 03:20:49,817
I came back because she always told
me that you were a very loving man...

1406
03:20:52,317 --> 03:20:57,817
that you were just hard from the
outside but very soft from the inside.

1407
03:20:58,192 --> 03:21:02,817
I came to break that hardness.

1408
03:21:04,192 --> 03:21:09,192
Do you know, Mr. Shankar, I do not
have any photograph of Megha...

1409
03:21:11,192 --> 03:21:14,108
I never felt the need for it,

1410
03:21:14,108 --> 03:21:19,275
because I see Megha wherever
I see love.

1411
03:21:20,983 --> 03:21:26,483
I thought if I could make
just one love story

1412
03:21:27,192 --> 03:21:30,067
bloom in front of your eyes,
you too would see her...

1413
03:21:30,067 --> 03:21:36,275
and you would see how happy she is
and that will take your pain away.

1414
03:21:39,858 --> 03:21:43,775
I had come to share your
pain Mr. Shankar

1415
03:21:44,442 --> 03:21:49,150
I had come to show you love.

1416
03:21:49,150 --> 03:21:53,067
I came here because l
realized one thing...

1417
03:21:53,067 --> 03:21:57,067
that Megha was incomplete
without you...

1418
03:21:57,067 --> 03:22:02,358
but you failed to realize that she
was incomplete without me too...

1419
03:22:04,858 --> 03:22:08,817
we together made her complete.

1420
03:22:08,817 --> 03:22:14,942
I came to complete what we
couldn’t do in her lifetime.

1421
03:22:16,733 --> 03:22:22,942
I came to complete her
I came to complete Megha.

1422
03:22:27,400 --> 03:22:31,317
You won every battle of life...

1423
03:22:32,192 --> 03:22:36,192
but you lost everything
that was worth living for.

1424
03:22:37,900 --> 03:22:43,608
You lost a daughter then
and now you have lost a son.

1425
03:22:48,317 --> 03:22:55,900
I am sorry sir, but from where
I see you lost everything.

1426
03:22:58,400 --> 03:23:05,483
Because I see a stubborn man
standing with his back turned...

1427
03:23:06,983 --> 03:23:15,650
to the two people who
truly loved him.

1428
03:23:27,358 --> 03:23:31,442
I am sorry sir, I am sorry.

1429
03:25:31,525 --> 03:25:35,025
For25 years, I have been
very proud of the fact,

1430
03:25:35,025 --> 03:25:37,942
that I’ve run this
institution with...

1431
03:25:37,942 --> 03:25:42,317
tradition, honor, and discipline,

1432
03:25:43,233 --> 03:25:47,233
believing that I have made
my students....

1433
03:25:47,900 --> 03:25:55,108
stronger, fuller, and better men...

1434
03:25:57,108 --> 03:26:01,817
men who will always come out
as winners in the battle of life.

1435
03:26:02,983 --> 03:26:08,900
I have been very proud of the
fact that somewhere there is a...

1436
03:26:09,692 --> 03:26:14,900
Narayan Shankar in each
and every student of Gurukul.

1437
03:26:15,983 --> 03:26:21,483
But, today, as I stand before you
I am not feeling so proud.

1438
03:26:23,567 --> 03:26:27,775
Because, today, I do not
like the Narayan Shankar...

1439
03:26:27,983 --> 03:26:33,192
who is standing in front of you.

1440
03:26:33,567 --> 03:26:42,067
Because today Narayan Shankar is a
man who did not come out as a winner...

1441
03:26:44,150 --> 03:26:49,442
in the battle of life...

1442
03:26:49,942 --> 03:26:54,858
...he has lost.

1443
03:26:56,067 --> 03:27:00,025
He is a sad, stubborn,
and lonely man...

1444
03:27:01,025 --> 03:27:06,442
who just did not understand
the meaning of life.

1445
03:27:08,817 --> 03:27:13,650
And today, when he looks back, he
cannot help but feel that somewhere...

1446
03:27:14,317 --> 03:27:19,817
all his students, must be sad
and lonely, just like him...

1447
03:27:22,817 --> 03:27:30,733
because he knows, he never smiled
at them when they were scared...

1448
03:27:32,525 --> 03:27:38,108
he never patted their backs
when they did well...

1449
03:27:39,983 --> 03:27:45,192
he never held them in his arms,
when they were sad.

1450
03:27:47,817 --> 03:27:50,400
Because he always believed
that showing any kind of love

1451
03:27:50,400 --> 03:27:52,983
and affection leads to pain...

1452
03:27:52,983 --> 03:27:57,775
and pain leads to weakness.

1453
03:28:00,192 --> 03:28:06,483
And in this process he became so
hard, that he forgot how to love.

1454
03:28:11,358 --> 03:28:17,275
And today he wants to go back
to each of his students...

1455
03:28:19,483 --> 03:28:24,067
hold them in his arms
and apologize to them.

1456
03:28:24,567 --> 03:28:30,233
And tell them one simple thing,
that life is about giving and...

1457
03:28:30,733 --> 03:28:36,233
receiving love, and nothing else,
nothing else

1458
03:28:41,025 --> 03:28:47,025
But he knows he cannot do that
he cannot go back.

1459
03:28:50,233 --> 03:28:54,442
But there is something he can do.

1460
03:28:54,442 --> 03:28:58,525
Something that he has not
done for25 years...

1461
03:28:59,025 --> 03:29:02,025
something that he should have
done a long...

1462
03:29:02,025 --> 03:29:06,025
time back, and that is change.
He will have to change.

1463
03:29:10,108 --> 03:29:15,025
The old generation will have to change
their old traditions, so that..

1464
03:29:15,608 --> 03:29:20,817
a new generation can create
a new tradition.

1465
03:29:26,108 --> 03:29:31,400
Now it’s time for me to step down

1466
03:29:33,108 --> 03:29:37,400
and give you someone who has
shown me that...

1467
03:29:37,900 --> 03:29:43,067
...respect is not earned by fear,
but by love.

1468
03:29:50,067 --> 03:29:54,483
Mr. Aryan, please come up.

1469
03:30:38,025 --> 03:30:42,317
I request you to please
take over...

1470
03:30:42,442 --> 03:30:46,400
and teach my students the
essence of love and life.

1471
03:30:56,192 --> 03:31:01,192
So that from now on
I can proudly say

1472
03:31:02,900 --> 03:31:09,400
that there is a Raj Aryan in each
and every student of Gurukul.

1473
03:31:12,692 --> 03:31:23,067
And probably then my
daughter would forgive me.

1474
03:31:24,305 --> 03:32:24,683
